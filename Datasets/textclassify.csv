"I had an enjoyable vacation this year since I filled each of the five days with my favorite sports activities. On the first day, I went to the beach and swam, and I got a wonderful sun tan. On the second day, I went sailing with a friend. We took our lunch, and we anchored in an isolated cove for a swim in the late afternoon. On the third day, since it rained all day, I stayed inside the cabin and read a good book about my favorite sports star. On the fourth day, my friend and I rented a rubber raft and went down the river in it. Because the rive had lots of rapids, we had an exciting ride as well as a lot of exercise. We even capsized the raft and got soaking wet. For the fifth day, my friend and I decided to climb a mountain. Again, we packed our lunch, and we ate it as we sat on the top of the mountain enjoying the view of the mountains, streams, and lakes spread out before us. To conclude, although I probably will not return to this vacation spot again, I will remember my athletic activities there for a long time.",sequential
"To get started, gather the ingredients and equipment. You need to find bread, peanut butter, butter, jelly, and a knife. Next, you should butter the bread. To do this, put two slices of bread on a clean part of the counter, and carefully spread butter on one side of each slice using the knife. Make sure the butter goes all the way to the edge of the bread and is evenly spread. Take care not to tear the bread. For the third step, you need to put peanut butter evenly across one slice and to the edge of the bread. Make the peanut butter about 3/8 of an inch thick. Fourth, spread the jelly on the other slice of bread. You can make the jelly as thick as the peanut butter. Be sure the whole slice is covered with the jelly. When you have finished spreading the jelly, you’re ready for the fifth step, putting the sandwich together. Take one of the slices of bread, and put it on top of the other slice, making the peanut butter and jelly touch each other. Finally, cut the sandwich in half with the knife and put both halves on a plate to serve it. In sum, if you follow these six steps carefully, the result will be a very delicious sandwich.",sequential
"Accepting criticism in a calm manner will yield dividends for four major reasons. First, by listening carefully and calmly to the criticism, a person will usually learn something about how to avoid problems in the future. Second, when the criticism is unfair, and the person has not done anything wrong, by listening carefully and asking calm questions, the person receiving the criticism will be better able to understand and explain how the problem occurred. More important, if a person refrains from becoming angry and abusive while receiving criticism, she will avoid making the person who is giving the criticism even more angry or upset. Usually, a person who gets angry while receiving criticism will receive some sort of punishment from the other person. The more angry the other person gets, the more severe the punishment will probably be. Most importantly, if a person receives criticism calmly and makes a genuine attempt to understand or to change, others will think that person is mature and responsible.",sequential

"Criticism can come from a variety of people. For example, criticism can come from a friend for hurting her feelings or for not returning a borrowed item. Another example of a source of criticism is parents. They often give their children criticism for such things as breaking house rules, poor grooming, or acting inappropriately. Teachers are a further example of people who often give criticism. They tell their students what they have done wrong on assignments, and they give out low grades to students. A final example of a source of criticism is bosses. They tell their employees when they have done a poor job, when they are late to work, and when they have made a mistake. In summary, friends, parents, teachers, and bosses are some of the people who are likely to provide criticism.",sequential

This point should be partially visible after the tree has been planted. Then after, dig a shallow, broad planting hole. Holes should be 2-3 times wider than the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball. After that remove the containers or cut away the wire basket. Inspect container tree root balls for circling roots. Straighten, cut, or remove them. Then, place the tree at the proper height. Finally, take care to dig the hole to the proper depth – and no more. If the tree is planted too deep, new roots will have difficulty developing because of a lack of oxygen.",sequential

This Interruption of the cells' divison cycle made it easier for them to reprogram themselves to start growing a new organism. After five days, the nuclei of these cell were removed and transferred into an unfertilized sheep egg, from which  the natural nucleus had previously been removed. in the next step. the egg was grown in the laboratory for a period of time.

"The overwhelming poverty that Sylvia (Toni Cade Bambara, ""The Lesson"" p.543) and Abner (William Faulkner, ""Barn Burning"" p.250) experience dooms them both to a life of self-destruction. Though from different worlds, Sylvia and Abner both experience hate, confusion, and anger because of their lowly positions in life. Instead of trying to better themselves, they choose to vent their dissatisfactions on others, and ignore the cause of the discriminations they face.  Sylvia and Abner have both experienced a life full of hardships. Abner has a history of commiting crimes for a living, such as the time he spent stealing horses during the civil war. Though from a completely different time frame and setting, Sylvia has also spent her life barely scraping by. When Miss Moore takes the children to the toy store, Sylvia's complete befuddlement at the idea of owning something that isn't useful vividly exemplifies how unfamiliar she is with wealth. Bad experiences in both Sylvia and Abner's lives with upper class people also plays into their uncivility twards anyone not as poor as they are. Due to Abners history as a sharecropper and criminal, it is quite likely that he has had many unpleasant experiences with wealthy people. In his story, Faulkner implies that Abner is no stranger to commiting crimes against his employers. In at least one instance, when he is shot while stealing a horse, Abner is physically punished for his lawlessness. Sylvia's distaste for anyone who might be considered better that her is evidenced by her dislike of Miss Moore. Miss Moore's education alienates her from Sylvia, who is disconcerted by her ""nappy hair and proper speech and no makeup.""",comparative
"Religion is sold to the masses daily. In 1925 it was sold to the masses in the form of printed material by Bruce Barton. In 1960 it was sold to the masses by way of a film entitled Elmer Gantry. Bruce Barton sold a different idea of Jesus than most people were familiar with. In the film, Elmer Gantry sold religion with bravado and arrogance which was not the typical way of selling religion either. In each work, religion is being sold but Elmer is a more exciting and relatable character than Bruce Barton’s Jesus. Elmer Gantry sold religion in a similar way to Barton’s Jesus but did so in a more relatable manner. In both works, each character sought out to sell religion. Although the major characters in each work were selling religion, their reasons for selling it were completely different. When Jesus was preaching religion, his reasons were noble. In The Man Nobody Knows, Jesus sold religion to save people. He claimed to be the son of God and was doing God’s work. He not only preached to the masses but also apparently had superhuman powers which cured the ill. “A woman who had been sick for twelve years…she said within herself, if I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole” (Barton, 1925). Not only could he heal people with a single touch, but his powers were so great that he did not even have to touch them to be healed. An ordinary person cannot relate to having superhuman abilities. Although Barton’s Jesus was portrayed to be greater than he was portrayed in the Bible, most people would be able to relate more to the Bible version of Jesus. Barton took Jesus and made him into an even greater character. ",comparative
"The hero of Beowulf, one of the oldest written Germanic epics, is a leader of the Geats and a hero unlike all others before him. He is able to conquer foes that no one else can, and he charges into every battle with the full force that he can muster, without any of the encumbrances that others may have. His greatest desire is fame and glory, and he performs whatever difficult tasks he believes will bring him closer to that goal. Beowulf’s quest for power drives him to seek fame by challenging Grendel, Grendel’s mother, and finally a giant dragon that causes his death. Though Beowulf’s strength and courage lead him to power and its accompanying responsibility, the power that he accumulates has negative consequences for those who rely on him. This very thirst for power is Beowulf’s fatal flaw, causing him to ignore his duties towards his people and leave his kingdom unprotected and vulnerable; however, it also serves as the force that allows him to accomplish unbelievable feats. Beowulf’s obsession with power leads him to disregard everything else that should be important to a leader and a king, including his duties towards his citizens and his country. Before he is made king, Beowulf travels to Hrothgar’s kingdom to fight Grendel and achieve glory by defeating the widely feared monster. After he wins the fight with Grendel and defeats Grendel’s mother who seeks revenge for her son’s death, Beowulf announces his victories to Hrothgar and his court, claiming fame as a successful warrior.",comparative
"A tragedy is defined as beginning with a problem that affects everyone, i.e. the whole town or all the characters involved, the tragic hero must solve this problem and this results in his banishment or death [run-on sentence]. A comedy is defined as also beginning with a problem, but one of less significant importance. The characters try to solve the problem and the story ends with all the characters uniting in either a marriage of a party. Although these two genres are seen as being complete opposites of each other, through further analysis one can gather that though they are different certain similarities can also be seen. One aspect of these genres that can be compared and contrasted is the narrative or plot. A comparison can be analyzed in that both begin with a problem. In Oedipus Rex, the play begins with a plague devastating the city of Thebes. In A Midsummer Night's Dream there is also a plague that is upon the land. However, a difference between these two beginnings is that in Oedipus Rex the citizen are effected by it to the point that they look towards Oedipus for a solution to their suffering; while in A Midsummer Night's Dream, the effects of the plague are never shown to the audience and it seems a minor detail. Another difference is the cause of the plague in the two plays. In the tragedy, Oedipus Rex, the hero ends up being the cause because he murdered the king; while in A Midsummer Night's Dream the cause is a fight between Titania and Oberon. Another point that can be compared and contrasted is the search for a solution in the plots. In Hamlet, Hamlet is searching for the truth to discover if his father was really murdered by his uncle and if this is true he must correct the situation by killing his uncle. Also, in Oedipus Rex this plot is seen in that Oedipus is searching for the truth about the murder of the old king, Laios, and the situation will be resolved by the murder being banished from Thebes. In contrast A Midsummer Night's Dream is more centered around the lovers trying to overcome the forces that separate them and Oberon seeking revenge on Titania.",comparative
"In a comparison of comedy and tragedy, I will begin by looking at narrative. The narration in a comedy often involves union and togetherness as we see in the marriage scene at the end of Midsummer's Night Dream. William Hazlitt tells us that one can also expect incongruities, misunderstandings, and contradictions. I am reminded of the play The Importance of Being Ernest and the humor by way of mistaken identity. Sigmund Freud tells us to expect excess and exaggeration in comedy. Chekhov's Marriage Proposal displays this excess both in language and in movements. Charles Darwin insists that in a comedy ""circumstances must not be of a momentous nature;"" whereas, Northop Frye identifies comedy as having a happy ending and using repetition that goes nowhere. On the other hand, narration in tragedy often goes from high to low. Oedipus is a clear example of this. At the beginning he is in a high position and held in high esteem by the people. By the end he has fallen to the depths of despair. Aristotle tells us that plot is the ""soul of tragedy,"" and he points out that we see this through an imitation of life through realistic actions. Taking risks and thinking big characterize narration in tragedy. Hamlet exemplifies these characteristics throughout the storyline. Aristotle insists that tragedy should have the right ending, which generally means that it will have an unhappy ending. We see this in Desire Under the Elms when Eben and Abbie are taken away to jail for the crime.   ",comparative
"Many people assume that the book and movie of the same story are always very similar, but they are incorrect. In my comparison of the short story Rikki-tikki-tavi by Rudyard Kipling and the movie of Rikki-tikki-tavi, I found them to be rather different. There were many minor differences, but the three main topics in the short story that clearly differentiate it from the movie are the setting, the character traits, and the use of humor. The setting in the movie differs from the setting in the short story in a few ways. The setting in the movie dives into larger detail in many of the scenes such as in the beginning flood scene. The flood scene setting in the movie reveals an eerie, strong, storm with a flood that resembles a river and flashing scenes of antique Indian statues, whereas in the story, Rudyard Kipling plainly states that there was a flood. Personally, I also felt that Rudyard Kipling leads you into thinking that many of the settings appear one way, but they do not seem this way in the movie. ",comparative
"High school, along with college are two major stepping stones in a person’s life. Many individuals are able to make the transitions from high school to college pretty easily, while there are others that find the transition into college to be somewhat challenging and hard to adjust to. When I made the jump from high school to college, I found that there are vast differences between the two, and both had very diverse environments. I found the key differences concerning high school and college to be the level of academic responsibilities, time management and scheduling, as well as the methods learning to be the main differences. Obviously, there is a major difference in the level of academic responsibilities between high school and college. In terms of expectations and responsibilities placed upon you in high school, they are more of a guideline and carefree, whereas college it is more complex and is individually based. What I mean by this is that in high school you can count on parents and your teacher in order to guide you in setting priorities and remind you of your responsibilities. It was part of your parents’ and teachers’ responsibility to make sure that you succeed in high school. Students have fewer duties to worry about, and fewer requirements where they could depend on others for help. In class, you are usually told by the teacher about what you need to study and how you are doing with your grades and attendance. Furthermore, in high school, many of the classes are assigned to you, and you are supplied with many of the materials and books. It’s an entirely different story once you enter college. ",comparative
"Every student typically has a great high school career. Classes are not very difficult; AP courses are an exception. Student workload is minimal, obtaining good grades is not much of a struggle, and exams are typically easy to pass. Course load outside the class is no more then a few hours of homework each week. Teachers and faculty help facilitate a moderately laid back culture to learning. 
The school system supports students to make sure their performance in classes in adequate to move on and aid students who are behind. Teachers, will typically pass students, even when there is a lack of understanding. Senior year is no exception to this. Teachers realize that seniors have little motivation to do work, especially as they get closer to graduation. Schoolwork is less rigorous and school is more social then educational, at least in my own experience. I will not be focusing on the differences in difficulty between the two because we all recognize that learning becomes more complex. 
The transition from high school to college can be a very controversial topic. There are many variables and opinions related to education alone. Some can say that the transition is a difficult experience. That many students struggle with the increased course load, advanced classes, and responsibility. Nonetheless, others can say the transition depends on many factors. A few being, the high school attended, the courses taken, and the student transitioning. Both education levels share the same similar teaching style, class instruction, and the learning styles. However, college is a choice. It brings new responsibilities, flexibility, and course structure. ",comparative
"The racism and discrimination against blacks in both Black Like Me and Black Boy show the hardships and racial injustice that blacks faced in the south with their share of differences and similarities. After reading Black Like Me and Black Boy, I have gained a better perspective, about how in Black Like Me when John Howard Griffin was a “black” man he was treated unequally as all blacks are and once he went back to being a white man those people who had treated him bad were now treating him with respect. However, in the end no matter the skin color some things are the same for both colors. In Black Boy, I have learned that the life of a young child, a black boy, is hard during the segregated south and can harshly affect the child while growing up. As I read, I came across some similarities between both works as well as some differences. Even though both works had their moments in which the characters faced struggles, I was still able to see optimism as well as hope for a better life and future. As I read Black Boy, Griffin provided me with a small insight on the way whites and blacks were differently treated. Black Like Me was based on a white man who wanted to get a better understanding of the life of negroes and how it feels to be treated unequally. He wanted to know what stood between the white man and black man, why they could not communicate. Griffin writes in his book that, “the only way I could see to bridge the gap between us was to become a Negro” (Griffin 1). His journey then began and he lived the life of a black man. It is with such bravery that he went and risked becoming a Negro. He knew that adverse consequences would occur once people knew the truth. He did not care.",comparative
"All throughout high school I’ve sat and listened to a countless number of teachers throw information in my face. Whether it be a new concept in math or a description of how to properly play kickball in gym. With all the years of hearing lecture after lecture, I cannot believe why I decided to come to college. I have signed and paid to have trained professionals throw more material in my face. One of the biggest difference between high school and college lectures is that I am no longer forced to listen. I pay the money, I make the decisions. In addition to the lectures, sports and a student’s social life are also different in college. Sports are either taken more serious or they are not. Even the social life of a student is subject to change. They could have been the most popular kid in high school and then come to college and have no one know them.
“You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go..”
Dr. Seuss: Oh, the Places You'll Go! High schools according to Mark Edmundson, author of Why Teach, are “credential factories in overdrive” (Edmundson 104). Students will spend their high school careers working to get accepted into the top schools of their choice. Building up their transcripts and getting the best letters of recommendation. High school is a steppingstone to college. It is a glimpse of the college experience. College classes are a big part of the college experience. Classes in high school usually range from 25-30 students. ",comparative
"One way to compare and contrast high school life and college life is student population. The population in college far exceeds high school enrollment. In high school the average number of students is seven hundred fifty and in college the average number of students is approximately seven thousand. Also, in college the authority figures are less visible than in high school. In high school, teachers restrain the students in all activities and events. Where as, in college the students are given more freedom to control themselves. Another difference is, in high school the hours are set in block form with no flexibility because the schedule is set by administration. College classes are more flexible because students get to choose what hours during the day they want to attend a class if an alternative is available. One way to compare and contrast high school life and college life is to look at the differences between high school teachers and college professors. High school teachers verbally explain what is expected throughout the duration of the semester. College professors give a syllabus which covers assignments and conduct. Taking class attendance is also done differently. Attendance is expected in high school with parent and administration approving any absences. In college, attendance is expected but students are solely responsible for attending classes. Another way to compare and contrast the two is to look at the teaching styles and methods. High school teachers teach from the textbook giving little if any notes at all. College professors teach lecture style requiring a great deal of note taking. One way to compare and contrast high school life and college life is to look at the athletic programs. In high school, students are getting the basic training for a specific sport that leads to being disciplined. College athletes are already trained and taught discipline to maintain focus on a sport. Also in high school, the students are not as strong physically because the body has not finished maturing. In college most athletes have already matured physically and are taught to improve and maintain their physique.",comparative
"The Aeneid is a poem of Fate, which acts as an ever-present determinant, and as such Aeneas is entirely in the hands of destiny. The unerring and inexorable passage of fate, assisted by the Gods' intervention, is impossible to prevent and its path does create many victims along the way, who are expendable for Rome to be created. In the Aeneid, mortals suffer, no matter what they do or how good a life they lead and they are unable to rely on the Gods for assistance. However, the Odyssey is a poem of morality, where the good are exulted and the bad are punished (""The blessed gods don't like wicked acts. Justice and fair play are what they respect"" O.14.84). It is the gods that uphold the distinction and are very active in passing judgement. No god supports the suitors or the Ithacan crew. Odysseus, the righteous man receives divine support since he is a man worthy of it. Not so in the Aeneid, where Juno supports the enemies of the Trojans, with such men as the dastardly Mezentius. In the Odyssey, destiny is one's own responsibility; instead of leaving all things up to fate, the characters have a significant influence upon his or her own existence. Whilst occasional prophecies punctuate the literary landscape of the Odyssey (e.g. the wanderings of Odysseus after he returns home, and the prophecy of Telemus), they are more poetic tools than fate determinants.

"In D.H. Lawerence's short story, “The Rocking Horse Winner”, and Grahm Greene's “The Destructors, there are many truths to consider.  Although these two stories are considerably different, the message is the same.  Whether in a life-like story, such as “The Destructors”, or a fantacy, like “The Rocking Horse Winner”, the seeds of materialism are planted and nourished in lives of the characters.  The aspects of materialism in these two stories develop desired conclusions by its characters.  In order to understand the similar message of Greene short story “The Destructors” and Lawerence's “The Rocking Horse Winner”, one must scrutinize the various aspects of each story. When comparing the themes of each story, surprising similarities arise.  First, both are developed around the lives of children.  In “The Destructors” a group of boys called the Wormsley Gang have the same view of the world around them.  They have grown up together and share stories about the bombs that destroyed their town.  They also challenge each other to accomplish various tasks.   The house that the boys ultimately destroy represents the greediness of Mr. Thomas, an architect who owns the tattered home.  The Wormsley Gang called him ‘Old Misery’.  In the Rocking Horse Winner”, the story’s plot is thickend by a a young boys obsessive desire to “become lucky”.  This young boy, Paul, believes that his house is continually whispering, “…there must be more money…there must be more money”.  Paul is able to relate the self-proclaimed dissatificatoin of his mothers life with the odd mood of his house.  Paul knows that although his mother appears to have everything together on the outside, she does not love him on the inside.  Paul believes that he can please his mother if he is able to find a way to give her more money.  In both stories, the houses were very symbolic. When comparing the emotions and feelings of “The Destuctors” and “The Rocking Horse Winner”, one will discover how their characteristics affect the plot. In “The Destructors”, Trevor, who is the more natural leader of the Wormsley Gang, discovers his own anger upon visiting the home of Mr. Thomas.  Trevor then fuels the already burning curiosities of the gang, by challenging them to do something about it.  In “The Rocking Horse Winner”, Paul’s mother is also angry.  She feels the life she desperately desires, is not being supported with her husbands income. Open Document",comparative
"I enjoy being a college student more than being a high school student. In the time that I have been in college, I have seen that more freedom is allowed to students in college than in high school. Such choices as the note taking, the environment, or class selection are a few examples of how college is less restrictive than high school. Because of the educational freedom and having more control over my education, I find being a college student more enjoyable than being a high school student. In high school, the classes that students take appear to be easy. They seem easy because when a person is in high school, he/she can just brush effects off. For example, if someone does not pay attention and does not do anything for the entire class period, he/she can copy someone else's notes and still learn the material because they have that class five days a week. Another reason high school classes give the impression of being easy is because a person can miss school/class, not get penalized, and most of the time the teacher will go over the material the student had missed. ""High school is mandatory and free whereas college is voluntary and expensive.""(Information for High School Students) On the other hand in college, the classes appear to be hard. A college student cannot just brush a class off. Well, he/she can, but they will suffer from it in the long run. For instance, if someone does happen to attend class but has no intention of paying attention to the lecture, he/she is going to suffer from not being attentive and will wish he/she did pay attention because most of the time professors do not review any of the lectures or material before a test. Like high school, a college student can copy another student's notes it may be slightly helpful, but not as much as if they had been in class and attentive. College classes are also hard because a person cannot really miss a class. In order to know what is going on and what assignments are going to be due, a student needs to attend every class if possible because he/she does not have the same class five days a week. In college, it is either two or three days a week and that is it. If someone does miss a class, it is very hard to catch up on what he/she missed.",comparative
"Both of these poems have many similarities in their content. They both have a relationship status in the poems. The author writes about his son as he is the father. The father thinks he has done a sin, a sin that god didn’t like. These two poems have relationships in which they incorporated to the author’s life. In ‘On My First Sonne’ this poem has a father son relationship in which the father ponders on the fact that GOD has took his son which is explained in the second line “My sin was too much hope of thee, lov’d boy.” This brings us to the conclusion that this poem has a religious view and can relate to as the date ‘1572-1637’ was in a different era where many of the citizens were very religious people. This shows that the father (author) cares about his son, and is willing to believe that god has took “Thou child of my right hand and joy,” for a punishment in which he believes for a sin he has done to god or his family. Ben Jonson the author, has wrote this elegy to explain his inner hurt, for this is an easy and creative way to vent his feelings and beliefs why his son has been took away from him. To write a poem this full with emotion must be hard and exhausting, he must have been very miserable as his son of his ‘gift’ had been taken back. “Rest in soft peace” suggests that Ben Jonson feels that his son was taken far too early for his age, also that he wishes for his son to be in peace. This line also makes us think that the father is saying goodbye to his beloved son. Ben has structured his poem, in a short length, to represent his son’s short life. This is a creative way share out his feelings. Ben Jonson’s poem reflects on the father’s pain for a lost child. He doesn’t usually write many poems that show his true feelings he normally is very cynical in his poems. ‘On My First Sonne’ this poem has rhyming couplets all the way through the poem, this poem has used many old English words so most of them are now pronounced different. So it’s as thought it does not rhyme. For example “Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay. Exacted by the fate, on the just day.",comparative
"The writers of 'Joining the Colours' and 'The Send Off' both use poetry to express their feelings about soldiers leaving for war. Each have similar attitudes about the subject, but use different approaches to try and get their message across. Both question the popular concept of war, including ideas such as heroism and glory. Katherine Hinkson, the poet who wrote 'Joining the Colours', shows the scene from two different perspectives, that of the audience watching the soldiers and also her own point of view. Wilfred Owen simply shares his thoughts by describing the soldiers leaving from a station, although the effect is no less powerful. As Hinkson is a woman, she focuses more on a mother or wives point of view, whereas Owen gives more of the soldiers perspective. The structure of each poem helps to add to the mood. In 'Joining the Colours', the rhythm is lively and regular. The rhyme scheme is also very simple and consistent, following an ABAB scheme. The constant rhythm and regularity of the verses gives the effect of soldiers marching. This is ironic, as although the scene is a jolly one, the rhythm contrasts with the poets feelings of sadness and despair. The rhyme scheme in 'The Send Off' is also very regular, although the lines vary in length and the verses are split into two and three lines. Owen also uses enjambment, which makes the poem feel disjointed and irregular. This shows that although the process of sending the soldiers off is very organized, the underlying feelings of the men are that of uncertainty and false courage. Both poems use short lines at the end of each stanza. This brings attention to these lines, and they are often the lines intended to be thought provoking. ",comparative
"chooling is a very important aspect in our lives and one must go through many steps to gain a higher education. Two of these steps are high school and college. Although high school and college students aim for the same goal, which is acquiring an education and graduating, the demands, expectations, and social atmosphere extremely contrast. There are many demands placed upon high school students. For example, high school students are obligated, or rather forced by law to attend school until the age of eighteen and they are required to do and turn in their homework. Even if you fail a class, students are required to take that class over until they pass; students have no choice, they must do the work or go to summer school. They are required to be a full time student, which means they have to take the necessary classes each semester, which usually consists of six to eight classes. However, there are few demands in college. The number one demand in college is that a student must pay their tuition on time. College students possess the right to decide if they want to show up for class or not. They can fail a class and not make it up and they do not have to turn in their homework if they do not feel like it. There is no law stating that a college student must attend class, be a full time student, turn in homework and pass each class. To a college student, the demand of attaining a higher education or graduating is completely up to that person. Expectations are another difference between high school and college. Students are expected by society to graduate from high school, therefore stripping the need for knowledge and replacing it with a need for a diploma. In high school, one is expected to show up on time and is punished if they do not. Some high schools have a room called sweep, or something of that matter, for students that are unable to make it on time and are forced to sit in a chair and stare at a wall. Nevertheless, college expectations are not as strict. In college, students are not expected to graduate, but instead are projected to educate and better themselves with or without a diploma. The reward is a career, and doing what they desire in life. Distractions such as friends can have a major impact on a high school student’s ability to concentrate.",comparative
"Mankind can be conceived in interesting ways by analyzing the writings of John Smith and John Winthrop.  As I read through John Smith‘s “A Description of New England” and John Winthrop’s “A Model of Christian Charity,” it became evident to me that the two readings had similar and different viewpoints of the essential nature of man.  Throughout my paper, I will compare their similar beliefs of community and diversity of people and completely contrast their ideas of emphasis on religion and relationships with enemies. Both authors stress a sense of community and diversity in order to survive in America.  Smith could not think of anything to “be more pleasant, than planting and building a foundation for his posterity, got from the rude earth, by God’s blessing and his own industry, without prejudice to any” (Smith 114).  This proves Smith believes everyone in the community should join together without showing any type of discrimination.  Likewise, Winthrop declares we must have “before our eyes commission and community in the work, our community as members of the same body” (Winthrop 225).  He basically wants the settlers to live and share their wealth as one joined community.  Smith and Winthrop also agree that diversity needs to exist in each community.  “Carpenters, masons, fishers, fowlers, gardeners, husbandmen, sawyers, smiths, spinsters, tailors, weavers, and such like” are the variety of men Smith found in America (Smith 117).  All of these types of men contribute a part of their lives to their community.  ",comparative
"The two most popular methods to lose weight are the low carbohydrate diets and the low fat diets. Both are in complete contrast when it comes to each diet’s food choices, the low carbohydrate diet which completely breaks the food pyramid limits a person to eating foods that are high in carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta and rice, while on the other hand, the low fat diet which follow the food pyramid limits a person to eat foods that are high in fat like meat, milk, and bean groups. Although each diet may sound very different from one another, they also share similarities. Both the low carbohydrate diet and the low fat diet claim that each is a good tool for weight loss. Even though their process in achieving weight loss and good health are in complete contrast; researchers found that each of the diets accomplish the same results. Starting with each diet’s idea, low fat diets state that fat is bad for the body they also address that not all fats are dangerous. Low fat dieters actually admit that some fats are needed to stay healthy. The low fat diet does not restrict a person from foods that contain fat. In an online article Choose a Diet low in Fat, Saturated Fat andCholesterol, it was stated that “Fats supply energy and essential fatty acids and promote absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K”. In contrast with the “good fat”, there is also a negative, which is the “bad fat”. Saturated fat, which is considered the “bad fat”, has been linked to high cholesterol and heart disease. It is mostly found in milk and other milk products. Therefore, the low fat diet encourages its participants to reduce saturated fat for it is the main cause of high cholesterol level. On the other hand, even though low carbohydrate diets do not state thatcarbohydrates are bad; they do state that it causes weight gain; this idea gives most Americans that it is bad because it causes a person to gain weight. When a person eats foods that are high in carbohydrates the body produces more insulin, which causes the body to quickly change food into body fat.",comparative
"The words kami in Japanese and shen in Chinese both are translated into English as the word god. Although they both refer to somewhat similar supernatural elements, they are by no means identical to each other. Chinese shen is an abstract term referring to spirits and relating to abstract thoughts such as the heavens and the afterlife. In contrast, kami are very often related directly to a person or actual object and are worshiped in a hope for more day-to-day help or this worldly benefits. In order to help explain the relationship between kami and shen, I will first explore the similarities between the two terms, then discuss the unique characteristics which define both shen and kami. Motori Norinaga, an eighteenth century Japanese intellectual, said that the meanings of shen and kami ""coincide seventy or eight per cent of cases… Ever since ancient times, their meanings have both been expressed in a single character… with no difference being paid to the difference between the two"" (qtd. in Xiaolin 1). When the Japanese first borrowed the Chinese writing system to use as their own, they used the Chinese character for shen to express both kami and shin (another Japanese word for spirits, more closely associated with shen.) In all of the Chinese texts that the Japanese imported, shen was translated as either kami or shin, using kami when the spirit was well defined and shin when it was more of an abstract thought. It was not until the Japanese later differentiated their writing from Chinese that the characters for shen and kami became different. The non-differentiation between the two words helps to show their close similarity to each other. ",comparative
"Although both Malena and Requiem for a Dream were released in the year 2000, they are very different films. There are multiple reasons why either film would be chosen over the other including storyline, affect on the viewer, actors/actresses, and the taste the viewer has with certain movies. Another aspect of the decision is the amount of themes a movie has and their importance. The more themes a movie forms the more a person can learn from sitting down and watching a movie. Malena is a romantic film about courage, lust, and cherishment. Requiem for a Dream is a completely different movie because it tells a story of four people's lives ruined and dreams destroyed because of an addiction to certain drugs. I believe that Malena was much better of a movie because it had a lot more to offer embracing its multiple genres, great performance without movie stars, and real life story convey perfectly. Requiem for a Dream is a great film that tells the story of four individuals that ruin their lives because of their addiction to drugs. Although the situations of how they become addicted were different, it showed the variety of ways addiction is caused and how it affects people's lives. I liked how this movie showed what addicts really go through when they're on drugs and what they do to get them once they're addicted. This movie takes the viewer to a different world, where people with great aspirations still come out on the bottom just because of drugs. We see this in horrible scenes where Marion uses sex to get drugs, which I believe is the ultimate low for a woman. We also see this in an extreme scene when Harry sticks the needle of heroine into his horribly rotten forearm because he is so addicted. Another time is when Sara, Harry's mother, starts taking diet pills that are really the drug speed, and then starts taking larger amounts until she experiences her last high and doesn't come back from it. I will never understand why drug addicts put themselves through so much. It really opens the minds of the viewers on what really goes on in the drug world and probably scares most people out of their casual drug use because of the horrors they see in this movie. Another thing I liked about this movie is that it used many known actors and actresses. ",comparative
"“The Day After Tomorrow” and “Outbreak” both raise important concerns regarding the world that we live in. The first movie seems to serve mainly as a warning that as a people of this planet we need to do everything in our power to stop destroying our world. “Outbreak” demonstrates the vulnerability of the United States and for that matter all nations of the world in dealing with large epidemics. Though both movies raise legitimate concerns they also both are quite sensationalized in order spice it up for moviegoers. The most effective movie in providing a wake up call for humanity is totally debatable and is entirely dependent on the eye of the beholder. In “The Day After Tomorrow” a climatologist’s warning of the possibility of massive cataclysmic climate changes caused by global warming go unheeded. His predictions of the consequences of such actions just so happen to occur sooner than anyone had ever expected. This movie served as the ultimate example what could happen if as a world community we do not clean up our acts. Continued consumption of nonrenewable resources, increased carbon dioxide emissions and further depletion of the Ozone layer could though most likely not on the scale illustrated occur in one form or another.

"William Bennett, editor of The Book of Virtues and co-director of Empower America, responded to an article that Andrew Sullivan had written supporting gay marriage in America. Bennett started out by first issuing two key points as to what divides the proponents and opponents of same-sex marriages. The two articles are derived from Sibylle Gruber’s Constructing Others: Constructing Ourselves edition. Bennett notions that legalizing same-sex marriage would weaken the meaning of it and outlines what the basic concept of marriage is. Throughout the article Bennett argues why same-sex marriage should not be legalized by moving from religion to the traditional concept of marriage between men and women, which he claims has a 4,000 year old history. Bennett argues that if gay marriage was allowed, it would bring about change to the traditional way of thinking for today’s youth. He also argues that simple, everyday human habits would also be changed to the extent of including social institutions (27). First of all viewing Sullivan’s perspective, he questions the definition of marriage by approaching the question as to why gay men and women in America are not accepted as everyone else. He writes that the definition of marriage changes dramatically due to the changes that America has undergone since the formation of this country. He also mentions that marriage has merely been a legal agreement between men and women, seeing women as property. Sullivan also notes that marriage was later recognized as matrimony between individuals of the same ethnicity, and the definition of marriage has changed throughout history.",comparative
"Last August, as a high school senior, I made a big transition in my life. Not only did I pack up my things and move to another city, I moved with the intention of acquiring higher education. I made the next step in my life by beginning college. High school life as I knew it was over, and my life would be new and different upon my arrival at school. My room, schedule, motivation, school life, money availability and parental influence has changed greatly. A major transition to make was that of adjusting to living in a dorm with a roommate. In high school, my room was decorated and filled with things from my life. The furniture arrangement and room size left plenty of extra room. I had a queen-sized bed as well as a large vanity with a full mirror. The other furniture in my room held trinkets and picture frames. My room had plush carpet and two big windows with curtains. It was not necessary to lock my bedroom door as I left. To be alone, all I had to do was retreat to my bedroom and turn up my favorite song. College rooms differ greatly from this description. One half of my dorm is full of things to which I cannot relate. Furniture lines the walls of the room and the small rectangle of space in the middle provides room for walking. My bed is twin-sized and is almost six feet in the air. The remainder of my furniture is tucked beneath my bed and holds many books and a few framed pictures of friends. The carpet is thin and puckered in certain spots. Leaving the door unlocked is not safe because of amount of people who bypass it daily. My window is thin and tall, commonly referred to as “suicide-proof” because it is not big enough for a person to fit through. The curtain rod holding the small fabric cut to be our curtain falls almost daily. I seldom enter the room when my roommate is not there. When I’m tired, she usually is watching television or is talking loudly on the phone. When I’m in the mood for television or listening to music, she is often asleep. ",comparative
"In this essay you will notice the differences and similarities between ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ and ‘Dulce Et Decorum Est’. ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ was written in nineteenth century by Alfred Lord Tennyson. In contrast, ‘Dulce Et Decorum Est’ was written in the twentieth century by Wilfred Owen. The main similarity we have observed is that they both capture war time experiences. However, the poets’ present these events using their own style, and the effect is two completely different observations of war. The themes of the two poems are portrayed in very distinctive ways. ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ explains in a majestic approach, that fighting in war is something every soldier should honour. The poem is also about the loyalty of the soldiers, not the bad luck or foolishness of men. Tennyson presents this in his poem to show the bravery of the soldiers, although, he only highlights on the benefits of war. Honour the charge they made, (‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’, line 51, Tennyson). This quote suggests that Tennyson’s poem glorifies the war, celebrating the sacrifice they had made for their country. By glorifying the Brigade, Tennyson has ignored the obscurity and massacre of the war; this is shown by the loyalty that the soldiers have for their country. The commitment of war in ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ is only shown because Tennyson's looking at war from afar .We can see this because in the poem he has not used descriptive language to describe what war was like, and has not shown the real outcome of war. In contrast, ‘Dulce Et Decorum Est’ gives us the complete opposite. It takes away the lie that describes the war as a place of pleasure and vividness. ",comparative

Both of these texts were written before 1914 by two different people.Thomas Hardy wrote 'The withered arm' and W.W. Jacobs wrote 'A monkeys paw'. The withered arm is a short story about a milkmaid who had an affair with a high class farmer. When the farmer gets a new wife, the milkmaid becomes jealous. In a nightmare, the milkmaid who is called Rhoda Brooks sees the new wife she had been obsessing over for the past few days in a horrific apparition gloats over her new husband. In this nightmare Rhoda grabs the apparition and feels her arm as if it were real as she throws the spectre to the floor. The ghost is gone when she looks down. The farmers' new wife, the next day, finds a new mark on her forearm in the shape of a hand in the same place that Rhoda had grabbed the apparition. Rhoda and Gertrude, the farmers' wife soon become good friends as her arm becomes increasingly more serious. Eventually Gertrude persuades Rhoda to get her to take her to a conjurer called conjurer Trendle who is a local magic man. Eventually Rhoda takes her and conjurer Trendle gives her advice but does not give a solution to her trouble. They return home to the village.

"Most modern fairytales are expected to have happy endings and be appropriate for children, nonetheless, in past centuries most were gruesome. Consequently, fairytales have been modified throughout time. The stories “Beauty and the Beast” by Jeanne-Marie LePrince de Beaumont and “The Summer and Winter Garden” by Jacob and Wilherm Grimm share similarities and differences. The two stories are distinct because of the peculiar year they have been written in. LePrince de Beaumont’s story is written in London of 1783 and Grimm’s in Germany of 1812. At the time, wealthy people in London, were educated and had nannies who would read to their children; whereas, in Germany, the Grimm brothers created their own interpretation into a short story. Because many high class parents in 18th century London would not be able to spend time with their children, nannies would read “Beauty and the Beast” to them since they were intended for children and considered appropriate. In “The Summer and Winter Garden,” the Grimm’s’ story was mostly based to entertain misbehaved children and teach them the valuable lesson that everyone should be treated with kindness. The Grimm brothers’ goal in rewriting this short story is to better children’s behavior which worked quite well. Since these stories have been re-written for children, it would be safe to say the reason why parents expose the two stories to their children is because they both portray the same moral: good things happen to good people. The two interpretations of “Beauty and the Beast,” although written in separate countries, share important similarities and differences even though the authors have different interpretations and came from different cultures.

"Ever heard the phrase “Opposites Attract?” The idea of two completely different personalities adoring each other, is mind-blowing. With Dally being a hoodlum and Johnny being very frail, how could the possibly even like each other? In the novel The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton, two characters, Johnny and Dally come together despite various similarities and differences. Although Johnny and Dally share some homogeneous traits, they also have very vast differences. For example, Dally is a villainous, tenacious, and greaser while Johnny is a perceptive, polite, and craven greaser. Dally does not fear anything and Johnny is petrified of his own shadow. His own gang thinks that Dally is mean, and Johnny is the gang’s pet. Dally spent three years on the wild side of New York and gets harder and tougher there, when Johnny has not even left the neighborhood. The description befitting Dally in the book just makes him seem even scarier. “His eyes were blue, blazing ice, cold with the hatred of the whole world… He was tougher than the rest of us [them] tougher, colder, meaner.” (10). This shows the confident, and indignant look on Dally’s face. On the other hand, the description for Johnny just radiates empathy and sympathy, “If you can picture a little dark puppy that has been kicked too many times and is lost in a crowd of strangers, you’ll have Johnny… he had a nervous, suspicious look in his eyes…”(11). The difference between the two characters is evident in these descriptions, Johnny is like a puppy and Dally could be compared to a tiger. Another example of how Johnny and Dally are different is seen through the fact that Dally loves to fight and has a huge record with the police, while Johnny detests fighting and has no record of police cases.",comparative

The poem doesn’t give the background of Grendel or show how the Danes killed his father and the possible reason of his revenge, like in the movie. If the witch, Selma, was not included in the storyline of the movie, the audience would not have known key information that she was used to show from more flashbacks. The witch gives more of an idea about Grendel’s past life that could have been the possibility to reasons for his actions. Some major similarities are the battles. Both epics include the battles between Beowulf and Grendel, as well as Beowulf and Grendel’s mother. The end results are the same, leading to their death, but the journey and process to the two tales are different. ",comparative
"Meiosis and mitosis describes the process by which cells divide, either by asexual or sexual reproduction to produce a new organism. Meiosis is a form of cell division that produces gametes in humans these are egg cells and sperms, each with reduced or halved number of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is restored when two gametes fuse together to form a zygote. A cell with two copies of each chromosome is called diploid cell and a cell with one copy of each chromosome is called a haploid cell. Meioses produces haploid daughter cells that are genetically different from each other and from the parent cell. However, mitosis is a form of cell division that produces daughter cells identical to the parent during repair or growth. Each cell contains the same genetic code as the parent cell, it is able to do this because it has copied it’s own chromosomes prior to cell division. Meiosis consists of two divisions whilst mitosis is followed in one division; both these processes involve the stages of interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. ",comparative
"The turmoil of the 1600's and the desire for more fair forms of government combined to set the stage for new ideas about sovereignty. Locke wrote many influential political pieces, such as The Second Treatise of Government, which included the proposal for a legislative branch of government that would be selected by the people. Rousseau supported a direct form of democracy in which the people control the sovereignty. (how would the people control the sovereignty??) Sovereignty is the supremacy or authority of rule. Locke and Rousseau both bring up valid points about how a government should be divided and how sovereignty should be addressed. Rousseau and Locke differ slightly on how the question of sovereignty should be addressed. Rousseau believed that men would essentially destroy themselves due to their ""mode of existence""(more explanation of what is meant by ""mode of existence""?) (Rousseau 39) and therefore must enter into a government that controls them. However, this control is in the form of direct participation in democracy where people have the ability to address their opinions, and thus sovereignty is in the control of the people. Unlike Rousseau, Locke believed firmly in the fact that government should be split up into a legislative branch and a ruling branch, with the legislative branch being appointed as representatives of the people. He contends that people give up the power of their own rule to enter into a more powerful organization that protects life, liberties, property, and fortunes.",comparative
"Lake Harriet is a great place to to swim and relax. In the summer, the water is warm and clean, and the beaches are large enough to accommodate groups of people seeking relief from a midsummer scorcher. In addition to swimming, visitors to the lake can go canoeing, sailing, windsurfing, or fishing. The blue water is a refreshing, tempting sight. The sweet scent of sun block wafts through the air from sunbathers lying on the beach. Children laugh and splash in the water, and nearby volleyball games stir passionate shouts in the heat of competition. Meanwhile lifeguards sit atop their towers and make sure everyone is safe. In the distance, sail boats catch the soft breezes that ripple Lake Harriet's surface, and canoeists glide quietly past. This is what summer is all about!",descriptive
"Last autumn, while on a trip, I decided to walk through a State Forest. This huge forest enriches the countryside not far from town and was a place where indians held hunting rights until recently. Little streams, ancient trees, shaded paths, and hidden places are some of the physical attributes which make the State Forest an enchanting place. I wandered leisurely along the shadowy paths, enjoying the peaceful surroundings. With only the songs of birds for company, I felt completely isolated from the crowds and traffic as I walked over the deep carpet of leaves. It had begun to rain a litt le when I first started my journey. However, small patches of sunshine soon began to filter through the giant oaks, promising that the rest of may day would be pleasant.",descriptive
"I first reached the part of the forest known as Bellringer's Hollow. Colorful wildflowers were blooming in a patchwork of bright yellow, azure blue, deep rose, and dazzling orange. Bellringer's Hollow was a magical place where, it is said, bells coul d be heard from time to time. Because the summer residence of the monks of Waltham once stood there, the local villagers thought that the spirits of monks rang those bells and watched over the forest. I lingered there for a while, listening to the gentl e sound of a stream as it flowed over the corks nearby. I also listened for the bells, but the bells did not ring for me. Maybe it was because I was an outsider! ",descriptive
The capital city of Italy is a very extraordinary place to visit. The population of Rome is well over two-million. The people there are very friendly and are extremely proud of their country. Rome is a beautiful bustling city that has a moderate cli mate. The temperature usually stays around eighty degrees. The main way of transportation is by bus. ,descriptive
"The side walk cafes are very popular in Rome. The cafes were always populated with happy Italians and a few curious tourists. The most preferred cafe was the Cafe S. Petro. this cafe was in perfect walking distance from the Vatican city. The Vatica n city is were the pope lives. The main meals served at the cafes varied from pizza to tortillini. The pizzas were not exactly like Pizza Hut's pizza. They were crispy thin with very few toppings available. Most pizzas came with cheese, pepperoni and a watery tomato sauce. The tortillini had soft, medium-length, hollow noodles with more watery tomato sauce. Another favorite at the cafe was the lasagna which was unbelievably delicious. After having tasted the pizzas and the tortillini, I was not exp ecting the lasagna to be so tasty. The lasagna was packed full of hot meat, zesty cheese, and a tangy tomato sauce. It was not out of the ordinary to see Italians, instead of eating at the cafe, talking with their friends and sipping on hot cappucino. ",descriptive
"The streets in Rome were always swamped with motor scooters, three-wheeled cars, and buses. Although, the main way of transportation are buses, Italians also scooted around on their motor scooters. The scooters were more convenient because the scoote rs could easily slip through traffic jams. The parking was very hazardous for people because some cars would be blocked in by a small car that was parked vertical between two horizontally parked cars. Car accidents were very common in Rome. When two pe ople had a car accident, they would just wave or yell at each other and drive hurriedly away. The police were not notified and there was no question of who would pay for the damages.",descriptive
"This picture, probably the only one in existence of all my friends together, has more meaning than it seems. At first, it appears to be nothing more than a happy congregation of teenagers, all from the ages of fifteen to sixteen. In the background you can see a fence enclosing a sand volleyball court. My friends that are kneeling on the bottom row are Shawn (who is affectionately known as Goose because of his long neck and his last name being Gosselin) and Paul. The ones on the top row are, from left to right, Brad, Matt, Kayla, Charlie, Jenny, Greg, Brent, and Daniel. I am at the far right side. You can tell by the expressions on some of their faces, especially Paul's, that they weren't quite ready for the picture to be taken, for more reasons than one. First, there was someone else taking a picture at the same time. Also, most of them never could have guessed that the picture would have to be taken in the first place. After all, I was supposed to be with them forever, right? Wrong. This was my going-away party. ",descriptive
"I made the decision to come to Baylor early in 1999 while my freshman year was still in session. At first, people thought I was joking about leaving, but when I persisted in telling them, they had no choice but to accept my decision. I had spent most of my life with some of these people, while some I had known for less than a year. I didn't think about that in the beginning. At first I was excited to go, but about the time of this party, the anxiety of leaving hit me like a sledgehammer. The party was August 10th. I left for Baylor ten days later on August 20th. Those ten days were some of the most anxious of my entire life. Was I willing to give up my happy existence to step into an unknown world of doubt? Well, as you may have guessed, since I am writing this paper, I was willing to take that chance. The question of whether it was worth it or not has yet to be answered.",descriptive
"Standing here, in this arena that is one hundred times larger than my home, I feel like a needle in a haystack. So many people surrounding me it’s like I’m one grain of sand in a whole ocean. The people around the arena form a black and yellow checker board. Their clothing meshes together and looks like a throw. Smelling the concession stand makes me feel like a starving child. The aroma of hotdogs and Italian sausage reminds me of a back yard grill. The smell of melted cheese on nachos makes my stomach growl wishing I had some. I can taste the pretzels as a man and child walk by me with one. The warm bread with coarse salt is delicious.",descriptive
"Every year I get this feeling. The knots in my stomach are pulled tighter every time I pass through the narrow rock arch labeled with an aged sign reading, Welcome to the Delta County Fair Grounds. My eyes peer into the distance, and like every year, the park is full of commotion and energy. Kids swinging on the swings, teenagers showing off their new school clothes while sitting on the chipped green tables eating mazzo dogs, and the various types of food stands, complete the atmosphere of the Delta County Fair. The fair is a place where parents enjoy themselves by spending quality time with their families; it's an ending to the summer and a beginning to a new school year. Entering such grounds would usually make a person feel serenity and excitement, but it is a whole different story when I drive under the rock arch entryway. ",descriptive
"It had been an extremely long and tiresome week at the fair, and it was written all over my face that I did not want to be there. Since Monday, a whole weeks worth of pay had gone towards gas, supplies for my pig and clothes to wear for the show. Today was different than any other day of fair; it was busy day of the livestock sale. ",descriptive
"As I opened my car door to make my way to the livestock barn, my nostrils filled with the mixed smells of hamburgers, funnel cakes, cheese fries, trash and manure. I always forget how the fair grounds had that unique smell on hot, windy days. The annoying sounds of hungry sheep and pigs echoed in my ears as I came closer to my destination. When finally reaching the old rustic barn, I began to make my way down the long cement alleyway, hoping that I would escape all of the chaos and end up at pen number thirty-five. This is where I would find my chubby pink pig lazily sleeping. My feet dragged, as the agonizing thought ran in my mind that I was once again going to have to go back into the show ring. Every time I set foot into the open arena something always ends up going wrong, and the huge crowd is always there to witness the event.",descriptive
"Adolescents like to have a place they can call their own. In the fifties, teenagers hung out at the malt shop, sipping cherry cokes and rockin' with Elvis. Today, in small town USA, they're jam skating while listening to the favorite group of the month. I was amazed to find a microcosm of life blooming on a 70 x 160-foot cement slab known as a roller skating rink.",descriptive
"As I entered the building which housed the rink, the warm, nostalgic scent of popcorn hit that part of my brain where dusty, cobwebbed memories live, memories of my own adolescence. I made my way past a group of exuberant teenagers at the snack bar until I reached the skating rink. Skinny, hard benches, made for small butts, lined one wall. I took a seat and scanned the rink. My eyes paused to read a sign; white, block letters on a black background warned, ""Skate at Your Own Risk.""",descriptive
"Two young men swaggered past me: confident, heads held high, eyes focused on their destination. I leaned over, looking down the long row of benches, curious to find out where they were going. Their confidence lagged a bit as they approached a large group of their peers, including several young ladies. All of them exhibited signs of discomfort as the girls crossed their arms over their nubile bodies and the boys tried hard not to stare.",descriptive
"Abruptly, a silent signal sent the entire assembly to the benches. Pairs of dexterous hands laced up skates as quickly as possible, while other hands aided in conversation that only the listener was allowed to hear. I was struck by the intimacy of this scene. They all knew each other well. They had come together in the freedom of this one place to share and explore without the encumbrance of parents, teachers, or any other meddlesome adult. I sat bolt upright, feeling very much like someone who had accidentally stumbled into a room full of naked people.",descriptive
"In my hometown, there is not much to do on any night of the week, so many nights I found myself walking around town with my friends. After walking an hour of so we would often become tired and need a rest. The swing along the Mississippi River was always a great resting spot. The metal swing fits up to four people and has a great view of the Lock and Dam. Although the swing was cold when we first sat down, it would soon warm up and sometimes we would end up staying there for hours just talking. The swing was also beneficial to us in times when we were feeling really stressed. Sitting on the swing gave me rest, relaxation, and peace. This is important to everyone, but many people find it hard to schedule relaxation  time. Between school, work, and other activities I often found it difficult to find time to relax and think. Finding a place that is peaceful can be even more difficult for some people. Not many people would think of a swing on the main road into town as a peaceful place, but I found it to be a great place. Places similar to this swing offer a place for people to get away from the hurrying and busyness they experience throughout the day. The place is calm and peaceful, and it offers beautiful sites to look at and watch. It is also secluded and away from much of the busy life of the town.",descriptive
"As I said before, my swing is located right along the main road into town and just outside the business district yet the swing still has a calmness about it. When I had a rough day at school, I would often go there because I knew I could be alone. The swinging motion of the swing reminds me of when I was a small child. The moving back and forth soothes me now just as it did when my mother would rock me back to sleep after I awoke.",descriptive
"Parks are a healing place. They function as a place for people to think and be alone. They are a great place to enjoy beauty while relaxing. Parks are located in ideal spots, such as in the middle of towns and cities, where people can gain access to them very easily. My swing in the park in Bellevue holds many memories for me. Memories of past conversations and even friends that have moved away. Being alone on my swing also helped me in many difficult situations. The time alone gave me time to think and I think sometimes my family found me easier to deal with, because I was not bringing my stressful life home to them. Sitting on the swing, watching the boats go by, and seeing nature's true beauty cut back much of the stress that was building up inside me. I found the swing to be my healing power.",descriptive
"My friend Josh and I didn't say much as we loaded our luggage into the rental car at Keflavik Airport. We'd just landed in Iceland, and already we were silenced by the landscape. ""It looks even more amazing in person!,"" Josh said as we took it all in. Since we met during at a gathering at an old friends' house, Josh and I had dreamed to traveled extensively through the world together, from the canals of Venice and Amsterdam to the mountains of Austria and Italy, but Iceland was our main place of excitement to visit. The surrounding lava field resembled something you would only see you in your wildest dreams, with huge moss-covered rocks haphazardly compiled on the ground, and funnels of steam rising to meet low-lying gray clouds in the distance. It was a formidable and alien landscape with no trees, no grass and no shrubs. We'd heard that Iceland was nothing like the other landscapes God has provided for us, and now we could see why. With the suspiciously simple verbal directions given by the rental car clerk, ""Just follow the road to Reykjavik."" The clerk wasn't kidding, there was literally one road out of the parking lot with a sign pointing to Reykjavik. Despite the barren landscape of volcanic rock that welcomed us, we were already warming to Iceland.",descriptive
"Iceland has the reputation of being a remote country, but it's actually North America's closest European neighbor, located relatively halfway between the U.K. and the U.S. There are many misconceptions about Iceland, and surely the name of the country doesn't help any. Far from freezing or being covered in ice, Iceland has a relatively medium climate, averaging 60 degrees in the summer and 32 in the winter. We were visiting in April, and the temperature during our stay was around 40 degrees, requiring a winter wear, but far from scarf and gloves-weather.",descriptive
"Jumping on the tourist bandwagon, our first trip was to Iceland's largest tourist attraction, the Blue Lagoon. The directions we received from our hotel's keeper sounded vaguely familiar, ""Follow signs for ‘The Blue Lagoon.'"" We drove through grisly lava fields but were getting closer to the wisps of rising steam we had seen from the airport. Suddenly the Blue Lagoon appeared, providing a visual thrill of electric sky-blue water in dramatic contrast with the surrounding black craggy lava hills. If the moon had lakes, I imagine they would look like the Blue Lagoon.",descriptive
"I think we all have a beautiful place in our mind. I have a wonderful place that made me happy a lot of times, years ago. But sometimes I think that I am the only person who likes this place and I'm asking myself if this place will be as beautiful as I thought when I will go back to visit it again. Perhaps I made it beautiful in my mind.",descriptive
"This place is meaningful to me because it is part of the county I loved, is part of the county where I grew up and is part of my childhood. This place is in the country in an old region named Appalachia, a small piece of the Appalachian Mountains, in a town named Pikeville.",descriptive
"Pikeville is a polluted town because of the coal industry. People live in apartment or condominium buildings because of its little space available. I grew up in one of the many buildings in Pikeville admiring from my bedroom window the beauty of the mountains, always exploring with my eyes the forest or the meadows, looking for a clean and quiet place. And, I found one on a hill in the back of the town. It is about 100 feet square, it has seven old trees, wild flowers and a lot of bugs and ants during summer time.",descriptive
"I used to go there to sit down on a rock and watch the town and my trees. There was a very old tree, a maple tree, with a huge trunk. The others were smaller, three in the back, three on my left side and the old maple tree on my right. There were flowers, many kinds, white, yellow, purple and blue. It was nobody's place. Nobody owned that hill, but it was beautiful and peaceful and I dreamed many times about a white house over there.",descriptive
"I think that, these kinds of places are meaningful to people because they are natural and people can be there alone, away from their everyday life. I used to go there to be alone or to dream with my eyes open admiring the blue sky or the clouds. I liked to go there to lay down on the grass, listen to the wind, kiss the flowers and watch the leaves moving. It was hard to go up the hill to get there, but I wanted to see everyday my seven trees, to see how the color of the leaves changed and to feel the softness of the grass.",descriptive
"It is years later and I can still remember my first visit to Lou's Cafe. Stopping in to see if anyone could tell us where to locate the turn we had missed, my dad and I received a large dose of culture shock. It seemed as if we had opened the door to a place where time stood still. Miss Lou Dixon owns and runs that restaurant in the middle of Small Town, USA.  Miss Lou has been in business at that location since 1954. Even though the place looks a little squalid, it is not for lack of care; in fact, Lou is proud of how clean she keeps her place.  She has often been heard to say, with the strongest East Tennessee accent, ""It don't matter how pore a body is. They can be clean.""  She is proud of her ""A"" rating and prominently displays it.",descriptive
"It is not a fancy restaurant.  The hundreds of booted loggers, railroad workers, and oil field roughnecks trekking through have worn the carpet thin.  Chunks are missing from the carpet at the favorite tables of the workers.  The hardened veneer on some of the tables is missing a notch here and there.  The paint on the walls has cracks and there is a perennial smell of hamburgers permeating the air. The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking the place is about to fold financially; instead, what we found that night was a well camouflaged center of social activity and the finest, most accurate, information available.",descriptive
"When entering the door at Lou's, two things are immediately noticeable: the place is rarely empty and seems to consist of a maze of rooms.  The first room, through the door, is the main part of the restaurant. There is another, rarely used, dining room off to the right.",descriptive
"I know to take one last breath of fresh, clean air before I open the front screen door and then the faded, chipped white wood door. I walk in, and the blend of the aroma of apples and old people suffocates me. As I walk in, the same two-year old cat food is right where it has been for the last six months: in front of the front door on the cold faded tile floor. The cat disappeared four months ago, but I guess there is still hope that he will come back one day. I approach the sliding wooden door to enter the front living room and see some bird feed on the floor that must have been spilled the previous week along with a stack of news papers. This single story brick house was purchased by my Grandma and Grandpa twenty years ago. Ever since, the house has been filled with nothing but love and laughter. Behind the house, there are five or six tall, skinny trees that have died from disease but haven't fallen to the grass covered ground. Near the loose clothes line in the back yard, there are four rose bushes that need water. Dead daises and pansies from the previous summer are the main attraction in the front yard along with a five foot high metal windmill stuck in the middle of a flower garden that needs grease. The two car garage houses a huge '78 black Buick. The ol' Buick hasn't been driven in a while, but my Grandpa claims that it is still in top shape. I guess my Grandpa just keeps it around to remind him of my Grandma. Next to it is a green John Deere tractor with a ripped black seat that has a flat left rear tire, but my Grandpa claims, ""It still runs like a champ."" Next to it is the push lawnmower.",descriptive
"For a half hour, every school day, for a few months, I was really happy. A friend and I would go to the drainpipe, and we would sit, talk, eat our lunches, and listen to my walkman. It was the perfect place: It was quiet, beautiful, and it was full of peace. It didn't matter whether it was cold or hot, somehow you didn't feel anything sitting on that drainpipe. You would feel the wind on your face, and it made your face cold, but inside, you felt warm and cozy, and you almost felt like you couldn't be harmed.There was something magical about the drainpipe. Maybe it was the fact that nobody was around except the two of us, and we were tiny compared to the long grass surrounding us. Then again, it could just been the freedom of knowing that we were listening to the walkman that was banned from school, and we weren't getting caught. What ever it was, it doesn't matter because analyzing something takes away the feeling it gives when you think about it. It was just a great place, and it made me happy, and I don't know why. That makes it better in a way, just knowing that it had that power. Everyday, I would meet with a friend at the drain-pipe. That is until a teacher found us and told us that because we didn't have any adult supervision, we couldn't eat there anymore. It felt terrible. I wanted to stay there. I had always thought that adult supervision was outdated by the time we were this old. We had come to this place to get away from adults and all the other P.C. people in this world, and now we had to join them again. At lunch time, I wander now, using the tape player in any open classroom and get into screaming matches with people, it's all just little kid fun anyway. Lunchtime isn't the same anymore. I wish the teacher had never found us.",descriptive
"My dad bought his red Dodge Dakota truck in 1995. When he got the truck it had already hit a deer and two cows. Since he has owned it, its value has gone down considerably, even though he has spent more money fixing it than he paid for it. If it was worth as much money as it has cost to keep it running we could sell it and buy a new car. It is red with a stripe down one side-- yes, only one side, the other side has no stripe, I have no idea why this is. There is also a huge dent above the right hind wheel that occurred when a horse tried to jump in the back of the truck. The new, improved, revamped bumper is bent slightly down from the deer and other things that it has hit. The back of the truck is mostly full of my dad's horse shoeing stuff. It is in no way neat or in any kind of arrangement. There are always empty horseshoe boxes piled to the brim. Underneath the boxes, balls of twine are entangled in old non-usable horseshoes. If you get inside of the truck, you enter a whole different place than the outside world. Notice that I said if you get in; what I mean by this is you can't get in through the passenger side unless someone opens it from the inside. The driver's side door doesn't open all of the time, and when it does you can't possibly slam it hard enough to get it to shut all of the way. Most of the time the passenger side is overheaped with trash, mostly empty pop bottles and cans. Inside it usually smells like horses. My dad shoes horses for a living, so the smell is on him and then is transferred to the seats and anything else that he touches. Also, he keeps his apron in the cab of the truck and it definitely smells like horses. Once in a while when I get in, I get a sniff of a mixture of vinegar and dust. The smell of vinegar comes from the homemade fly spray that my dad makes, and the smell of dust is from all of the dirt that is that has gathered in the corners on the dash.",descriptive
"The ruckus from the bottom of the truck is unbearable, because of the noise and excessive shaking. As we slowly climbed the mountain road to reach our lovely cabin, it seemed almost impossible to reach the top, but every time we reached it safely. The rocks and deep potholes shook the truck and the people in it, like a paint mixer. Every window in the truck was rolled down so we could have some leverage to hold on and not loose our grip we needed so greatly. The fresh clean mountain air entered the truck; it smelt as if we were lost: nowhere close to home. It was a feeling of relief to get away from all the problems at home. The road was deeply covered with huge pines and baby aspen trees. Closely examining the surrounding, it looks as if it did the last time we were up here. We slowly crept around the corner, finally sneaking a peek at our cabin. As I hopped out of the front seat of the truck, a sharp sense of loneliness came over me. I looked around and saw nothing but the leaves on the trees glittering from the constant blowing wind. Catching myself standing staring around me at all the beautiful trees, I noticed that the trees have not changed at all, but still stand tall and as close as usual. I realized that the trees surrounding the cabin are similar to the being of my family: the feelings of never being parted when were all together staying at our cabin. As I walked closer to the cabin, which has been abandoned since last summer, I noticed certain materials are stored away, for the winter, such as the grill, which is taken off the hinges around the fire pit, and put underneath the cabin deck. The canoe is upside down and tightly snugged underneath the cabin deck. I also noticed the picnic tab. I've realized that the cabin reassures the family bond, we have so greatly between each other, and gives the family hope that we can always have a place where the family, as one, is welcomed. Although we live in different cities, this place gives me the belief that my family will always be there. When the whole family is up at the cabin, it seems as if nothing has changed, as if the pine trees have not grown apart, or any taller. The pine trees drop their children pinecones right next to the parent, never being able to leave. This symbolizes the feeling I get about my family while being up in the mountains at our cabin.",descriptive
"When people discuss Naples and describe the sights, they usually just mention the beach, Fifth Avenue, and the swamp. To the people who live here and experience the unseen places, there is much more. There is one place I particularly like. That is Horseshoe Lake and it is a lake where some of the greatest fishing experiences occur that include catching large fish and relaxing with a friend.",descriptive
"Nestled in the foothills of northern Maine sits a beautiful scenery of flowers, animals, insects, birds. Amongst these organisms a beautifully constructed log cabin of monumental size is nestled in the distance. Much of the land that is surrounding the log cabin has never been touched or even seen by man, but I feel like that is about to change. Many of the animals not ever seeing a human being in their life time are oblivious to humans and foolishly getting themselves in trouble. Much of the time I have spent there is during the summer times with my family. My family is an important part of my life, I have grown to have a close relationship with my grandfather and father and that is something that I could be losing. Most of the surrounding cabins are destroyed now. Logging. We are now in jeopardy of losing our cabin as well and all the family ties, tradition, relationships and secrets will all be lost if our cabin is destroyed. I need that cabin to stay because without it much of my childhood memories of my grandfather will be lost forever.",descriptive
"Assisi is a town located in the province of Perugia and Umbrian region of central Italy. It is located at the foot of Monte Subasio, which is 1300 feet or 400 meters above sea level. The narrow, winding streets and the surrounding city walls are indicative of the region's medieval history. Although the town is primarily known as the birthplace of St. Francis, it was an important location for the Umbrians, Etruscans, and Romans. As an ancient Umbrian center, the townspeople fought with the neighboring Etruscan cities. In 89 BC, Assisi became a confederated Roman city and a municipium named Asisium. Today the remains of the Roman forum, the amphitheater, and most noticeably the Temple of Minerva serve as a testament to this city's ancient Roman origins. In the early Middle Ages, the town was subject to the dukes of Spoleto, and in the 12th century, Assisi became an independent commune involved in internal disputes and wars with Perugia. It joined the Papal States in the 16th century and the Italian kingdom in 1860. The medieval architecture and religious artwork left by the various inhabitants of Assisi have given this town a timeless quality. Although it is a town of the twenty-first century, millions of tourists and religious pilgrims flock to the area seeking simplicity, reflection, and peace.",descriptive
"When we are young, most of us are somewhat naive. We are inherently taught that good will always triumph over evil. A courthouse is the forum where evil should be dealt with. But, in reality, this is seldom the case. The county courthouse looks like a typical courthouse. The courthouse itself looks like a place where justice is served. It is a Romanesque building, three stories high, with large pillars in the front. Ivy grows up one side of the building. The green grass in the courtyard is immaculately kept. The United States flag flies high above the building. Etched in stone on the front wall of the courthouse are the words"" truth, justice, and liberty."" This is a place where one should feel truly safe. As I walk inside the cold and quiet building, a young woman is talking with the circuit court clerk. She is very innocent looking, with blond hair and a petite figure. She seems to be getting more upset by the second. The young lady finally erupts, yelling and almost crying. Her ex-husband has not paid her child support in month, and she cannot buy diapers for her baby. The clerk tells her that nobody can do anything about it until he is six months behind in his support. After five more minutes of intense arguing, the young lady, now engulfed in tears, leaves. The clerk shrugs and turns around. The building seems colder upstairs. There almost seems to be a dampness in the air. Down a corridor there are empty offices and paintings of important looking people. I recognize two of them as Washington and Jefferson. In between them is a copy of the constitution. As I read it I chuckle, and wonder if this government is really what they had in mind. Farther down the hall I hear voices. The general court is in session. Inside the courtroom, a scruffy-looking man is in front of the judge. He has been charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest. He does not seem nervous; he has probably done this before. I assume he will be put in jail for a little while, at the least. The judge tells the man that he does not want to see him in court.",descriptive
"My mom and I were cleaning up our attic this weekend, and in the process I found all sorts of old junk that I had forgotten about. Of course, I wanted to keep everything I saw; otherwise, I would not have stashed it there in the first place. But after standing over me and prying my hands off of every item that I encountered, my mom finally convinced me to haul all of my broken treasures to the Dump. I wince at the thought of having to brave the ever-present gloom that reigns there. The Dump is a strange and repulsive place, where people tend to bury the human spirit along with their refuse.",descriptive
"Piazzetta Vescovato is not just the prettiest square in the heart of Brescia’s historic downtown. Piazzetta Vescovato is a powerful symbol. Nested between Corso Zanardelli and Via Trieste, this little site has been a meaningful part of the lives of generations and generations of Bresciani (inhabitants of Brescia). Half a century ago, la piazzetta(as I like to call it) witnessed the horrors of the Second World War, when frightened people stepped on its sanpietrini(those little cubic stones that made up the pavement of medieval European streets), attempting to escape the Nazi soldiers or to reach a rifugio,an underground cellar that offered protection from the bombs thrown down by German planes.",descriptive
"My mind was empty and full of boredom, and the only way to satisfy this void was to draw. It was midday at my house, and my four-year-old attention span was not able to handle not drawing. I scurried around my parent’s office looking for the holy grail of colors and found it in the waxy smell of Crayola crayons: a magnificent, bright, and vivid pack of 12 colors. I began my search for the last piece of the puzzle--the white copy paper to draw on. Searching for what seemed like forever (most likely a minute), I gave up and began another exploration. I scouted for my mom, who I found talking to someone on the phone and too busy to help me. This dilemma became a devastating blow. With no one to help me look for paper, I needed to take action and exterminate this problem! Walking down the hallway of the house with crayons in hand, I came across a wall of pure white. I looked up and down the wall, realizing I had an opportunity here to do something different. The wall seemed to draw me in; I reached out with a crayon in my tiny little hand. Within minutes, a chaotic mess of colors covered the wall, and as the deed was done, a wonderful feeling of destroying my boredom filled me. I gazed at my gorgeous masterpiece and, at the time, concluded that my landscape looked impressive. Wanting my mother to see my work, I tugged on the side of her shirt and led her to the once white wall. She stood there in astonishment at the taboo I had just committed. However, when my mother found out what I did, she did not get angry or yell at me; she accepted this odd way of thinking and creativity. This is how my creativeness as an artist truly began.",descriptive
"The sound of the wheels from a skateboard on the pavement rattles my head. The only thing stopping the pounding noise was the slight breeze of air that flew through cooling down all the noise. Blowing through the blue curls in my hair the wind covered my ears. No worries could reach me in this moment. The excitement to get to the library kept me flying down the road. I could already imagine the smell in the air of old paperback books enveloping my nose. Getting to run my fingers over new books hard spines that hold the forever stories together.I 'm lost. This girl with the blue hair is not me--she is whom I wish to be. Annaleah is who she is and she shows the true me when I dont have the ability. I am the girl with my face plastered on every street corner light pole that Annaleah flew past on her skateboard. I 'm missing and I can 't find myself, my brain is so clouded, I went missing. The girl in my head with the blue hair always picked at my brain. She is the girl I created when I was just a freshman in high school. The only thing I relate to are the spines on the books the blue haired girl wants to run her fingers over. However, not the spines of new books. I’m the spine of an old book that resembles rubber as it can bend. All up and down the spine are cracks where the book was opened and shut and tossed aside while cleaning, bent, worn out, causing the ability to see what the spine is made of. Picking at it until the feeling of rubber from the glue used to keep the book together starts to crumble and stick into the crevice of your fingernails. I am a rubber spine, I avoid my responsibilities, wishing to be a character I made up in my head.",descriptive
"The photo—which my mama now held lovingly in her grasp—I hadn’t realized sat encased in an actual silver frame. When I had touched the frame to draw it close so I could take better look, a shock of static electricity pierced through me. The sudden surge of energy making a snapping, popping sound as an arching bluish bolt of lightning jumped from the metal to my finger tips. “Ouch,” I muttered as I quickly reeled my hand back before touching my fingertips to my lips.
“Oh, did it get you?” my mama asked after having heard the sound and possibly even having saw the spark strike before I jumped back. “Yeah, you’ve got to watch out for that in this house. These old carpets still carry one heck of a charge. I used to get shocked like that all the time when I was a little girl. So… Well, you’ll get used to it. You’ll have to get used to a lot of weird things around here but I think you’ll be okay.” I hadn’t realized at the time what my mama might have hinted at. And honestly, until I sat down and started writing this memoir I hadn’t realized much of anything she’d been hinting at about Mt. Harrison, my grandmother’s house, or what might ultimately happen to me here.You’ll have to get used to a lot of weird things around here, yeah—I’d say that was an understatement. Just then my Step Daddy Cade came walking up from behind the two of us after having been somewhere else in the house and he said, “I’m gonna finish unhookin’ the trailer then head back into the village to go to one of those supermarkets we’d passed.

"I have always found it fallacious that so many people feel the need to speak about someone and assume things that are completely inaccurate. As an older brother I have I had alot of responsibities, so sometimes I babysit my little Brother who is 3 years old. However everytime I go out in public with my little Brother people always assume that he’s my son. I never get frantic but every now and then someone will make an absurd comment that I would not be so kind to. I remember one weekend day after taking my brother to the park, we decided to go to Jack In The Box. When we ordered our food I felt like there were these two ladies staring at me from their table. As me and my Brother sat down at our table to wait patiently for our food, I overheard the same two ladies gossiping while still staring at me. They were staring as though aliens just landed in front of them. Then one of the ladies had the audacity to come up to the table where we were sitting. She told me in a rude manner that I looked to young to have a child, and this would be the biggest mistake that I ever made. At that very moment I felt so disrespected and enraged with this women 's ignorant comment. After deciding to keep my composure I corrected her by saying that I was with my little brother and that she couldn’t have been more abrupt with her remarks. At the end she knew that she was wrong but refused to apologize and instead stormed off with her friend. This would not be the first nor the last time someone would choose to make a rude comment and assume that I am my little brothers Father. Even if I was his father, no one should feel the need to judge, because there are young parents who do the best they can for their child.",descriptive
"Driving with my dad those countless hours gave me plenty of time to say goodbye, but I just couldn’t form the words. So instead when pestered each other with our normal banter, annoying each other with pun filled jokes that incited a groan instead of a laugh. My dad filled the time with stories, telling me about his childhood, his father, and grandfather who I never had the pleasure to meet. At that time, though I never actually said goodbye or how much I’d miss him, this was in a way our way of saying it without actually speaking. Yes, we’d see each other again, but they’d be spread thin, mostly in the summer months when school was out, but I was used to making him breakfast in the mornings as we each got ready, him for work and me for school. I was used to greeting him when he came in the door with a witty comment and a hello that would cause him to roll his eyes. I was used to helping him making dinner and listening to him purposely butchering the lyrics to my favorite songs. These things were a part of my everyday life and when we reached our destination they no longer would be. We reached Texas and our hotel in the middle of the night and nobody had the energy to say or do anything but climb in bed and sleep. Tomorrow would be the day we saw my father new abode, tomorrow would be the day which we would move him into a new home inhibited only by him. The morning was a blur of packing up the little we’d unpacked, eating breakfast, and climbing back into the cars we’d become so accustomed to and heading off to a new chapter of life. The apartments which my father had chosen were nothing special, but my dad stated, “As long as I have a roof over my head, walls, and a bed. I’ll be fine.” ",descriptive
"On a stormy night in January 1878, an angry mob of citizens gathered in Carrollton, Alabama with one purpose in mind. Even though the wind blew hard and thunder roared, their eyes were locked on a single window in the courthouse and their cries for justice kept them from hearing the coming storm. They were there to get revenge from the man who had burned the symbol of their recovery from Yankee defeat (Windham and Fish 64). A suspect had been arrested on circumstantial evidence and was being held in the attic. Henry Wells, the accused, watched the crowd grow from the window upstairs. He was terrified that his life might end before the night was over. What happened next assured him that at least his story would survive. A sudden flash of lightning captured the image of his face in the garret window of the Pickens County courthouse. Many believe it is a visual reminder of the threat Wells shouted from the attic, “If y’all come up here and kill me, I’ll haunt you for the rest of your lives. I swear” (Johnson)! The legend of the face in the courthouse window is about a community who reacts to similar disasters with determination, exaggerated expectations and superstition instead of logic. The Face in the Courthouse Window has become one of the most interesting mysteries in Alabama and is the most famous thing about Carrollton, Alabama. Carrollton became the county seat of Pickens County in 1830. The first courthouse was burned by Union soldiers in 1865. Citizens united together to rebuild the courthouse shortly after the war even though money, material and labor were hard to find. They had to sacrifice to rebuild the courthouse (Windham and Fish 64).",descriptive
"On the Thursday morning of March 15, 1781 in North Carolina, the Battle of Guilford Courthouse took place. The Battle of Guilford Courthouse is part of the American Revolution that took place between 1775 and 1783. This battle was between the British and the Americans because the Americans no longer wanted to be governed by the British. They believed that they could run the country by themselves without England’s help. Although most of the battles during the American Revolution took place in the North, the Battle of Guilford Courthouse took place in the woods and fields of Greensboro, North Carolina. The Americans were backed up by the French and the British campaigned in hopes of recruiting American colonists who were still loyal to Great Britain. Major General Lord Charles Cornwallis led approximately 1,900 veteran regulars and German allies into battle. 4,500 American militia and Continentals were led by Major General Nathanael Greene. The militia are made up of mostly farmers who were unprofessional and were only temporarily and were used in times of emergency. The British wore red coats and bearskin, leather, tricorn hats depending on what their job was. The Americans weren’t as well dressed as the British, but they tried their best to look nice. They were dresses in various uniforms and an array of country clothes. As the war progressed, the Continentals began to wear blue uniform coats, but the militia kept their other clothes. Continentals are men that are three year enlistees in the regular army. Both the British and the American were armed with guns and muskets, but the Pennsylvania regiments had long, small caliber, rifled weapons that they carried.",descriptive

The night before I was scouring the web, trying to figure out all the details I needed to know such as how to get there, the court schedule that morning, what time I had to leave my apartment, what I had to take note of while I was there, etc. I did not want to waste my time being clueless at the courthouse not knowing where to go when I had an assignment to accomplish. I wanted to be prepared for anything because I did not know what to expect. Growing up, I watch television shows like Law & Order: SVU, Suits, and How to Get Away with Murder, but never have I ever been to an actual courthouse and observed a case or hearing. It was a long walk to the Link light rail station, but a beautiful Tuesday morning. Commuters left and right starting their day and minding their own business, while they wait for their stop. The ride was fast and the walk was just across the street. Arriving just a little before 9:30 am, I went through security and asked where I could find the daily schedule. While reviewing the schedule, I met another guy in the same class named Phoenix. The both of us assumed that we were late for most cases that started at 9 am. Therefore, we decided to attend the only case we saw on the schedule for 9:30 am in Room E-960. Not knowing what the letter or numbers meant, we asked the guard where the room was. “Ninth floor, East Wing,” he muttered in a deep voice.",descriptive

My story is slightly more unique than that. I started drugs because I was not satisfied with the everyday life. Life was just too boring and routine for me. My sophomore year of high school I discovered my brother's ADHD medication, Adderal. My first experiences with Adderal were pure satisfaction. Take enough of the drug and you will sit in one spot for 8 hours talking your head off and it will feel as if it was only one hour. It was the most content feeling i have ever experienced in my life. Adderal effects everyone differently, most just feel that satisfying buzz but for me it was so much more.

"In today’s society, divorce is more the norm than ever before. Forty percent of all marriages end in divorce. Divorce defined by Webster is the action or an instance of legally dissolving a marriage [1]. Divorce itself is both a cause and an effect. Some of the causes of divorce include the lack of money, sexual indiscretion and the ease of getting a divorce. These are some of the most common causes of divorce. Further, the effects of a divorce seem insurmountable when comparing the grief it causes on both parties. This paper will describe some of the causes and effects of a divorce. Many people cite money as a cause of divorce. In fact, the statistics of a survey conducted by Citibank on divorce in the United States suggested that more than fifty percent of divorced couples cited money problems as the cause of their divorce [2]. I believe that money has a role in society and in marriage. However, the lack of money does cause discord between a married couple. This can be referred to as financial incompatibility, which is based on the views that each partner has of the partnership of marriage from a financial viewpoint [2]. Further, he/she should also think about the effects of divorce on their financial situation. Also, they should know that divorce does not solve financial problems. Instead, the divorce must be paid for and the divorced couple must now set up two households instead of one. Further, This is a classic example of why divorce is not necessary and sex indiscretion is. Sexually indiscretion is the second leading cause of divorce. Sexually indiscretion should never happen if you truly love your mate. When you commit sexual indiscretion you’re sending out a signal that you mate is not enough for you. In doing this you break a bond between you and your mate. The effect of sexual discretion is diverse stating. This will lead to a lack of trust between both parties involved. This particular bond once broken can not be mended in most cases. However, when sexually indiscretion is committed a divorce is inevitable. Once a divorce is inevitable due to sexual indiscretion it is easierly attained. In the opinion of some, the no-fault divorce laws have led to the increased rate of divorce. The increase is contributed to the inexpensiveness of getting a divorce, because of the no-fault laws.",cause and effect
"People have been deforesting the Earth for thousands of years, primarily to clear land for crops or livestock. Although tropical forests are largely confined to developing countries, they aren’t just meeting local or national needs; economic globalization means that the needs and wants of the global population are bearing down on them as well. Direct causes of deforestation are agricultural expansion, wood extraction (e.g., logging or wood harvest for domestic fuel or charcoal), and infrastructure expansion such as road building and urbanization. Rarely is there a single direct cause for deforestation. Most often, multiple processes work simultaneously or sequentially to cause deforestation. The single biggest direct cause of tropical deforestation is conversion to cropland and pasture, mostly for subsistence, which is growing crops or raising livestock to meet daily needs. The conversion to agricultural land usually results from multiple direct factors. For example, countries build roads into remote areas to improve overland transportation of goods. The road development itself causes a limited amount of deforestation. But roads also provide entry to previously inaccessible—and often unclaimed—land. Logging, both legal and illegal, often follows road expansion (and in some cases is the reason for the road expansion). When loggers have harvested an area’s valuable timber, they move on. The roads and the logged areas become a magnet for settlers—farmers and ranchers who slash and burn the remaining forest for cropland or cattle pasture, completing the deforestation chain that began with road building. In other cases, forests that have been degraded by logging become fire-prone and are eventually deforested by repeated accidental fires from adjacent farms or pastures. Although subsistence activities have dominated agriculture-driven deforestation in the tropics to date, large-scale commercial activities are playing an increasingly significant role. In the Amazon, industrial-scale cattle ranching and soybean production for world markets are increasingly important causes of deforestation, and in Indonesia, the conversion of tropical forest to commercial palm tree plantations to produce bio-fuels for export is a major cause of deforestation on Borneo and Sumatra. Although poverty is often cited as the underlying cause of tropical deforestation, analyses of multiple scientific studies indicate that that explanation is an oversimplification. Poverty does drive people to migrate to forest frontiers, where they engage in slash and burn forest clearing for subsistence. But rarely does one factor alone bear the sole responsibility for tropical deforestation. State policies to encourage economic development, such as road and railway expansion projects, have caused significant, unintentional deforestation in the Amazon and Central America.",cause and effect
"Stereotyping, which can be used positively and negatively, is something everyone uses every day; it is found in our humor, how people describe one another, and beliefs. People stereotype without knowing it; it is a way we use to help us understand a group. The problem with stereotyping is that it’s a self –opinion about a group, not an individual. Everyone has their own unique and distinct personalities, just as everyone has their own fingerprints so it is unfair to be judged quickly by people who do not know others as an individual. Everyone is a victim of stereotyping and have stereotyped before. It is a worldwide issue that can be easily solved yet it continues every day. The causes of stereotyping come from many places, a major influence is the media, it portrays stereotyping in the movies, the news, and many other ways, but people mostly learn from what others say. Most stereotypes are determined by appearances; the way groups, culture, or genders look and act are very different from each other (Macrae, Neil. Stereotypes & Stereotyping. New York: Guilford Press, 1996). Appearances are a major part in stereotyping because certain groups have looks to them that people identify them with. When one sees someone or some group looking different from what they believe is normal, they quickly categorize them from what they learned on TV or the news. Women are seen as fragile, obsessed with their looks and are clean freaks. Although this is not entirely true, stereotypes of women are still apparent today (Heights). Even when women are becoming stronger, there are still those remarks about how weak and fragile they are. These stereotypes have a long history, making old habits hard to break. Teens are stereotyped constantly by adults.",cause and effect

Finally a car in that fourth lane of traffic stopped, causing the car behind it to slam on the brakes, literally coming to a screeching halt. Had the man and child started across the street and the screeching car not been able to stop, it would have hit the already stopped car pushing it forward, hitting the man and child.

"It is important to take the subject of suicide seriously. It doesn't seem right that a teenager, who has lived for such a short time, would choose to die, but those who can't get over their depression sometimes do. Teen suicide is the third leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 24 and the fourth leading cause of death for persons between the ages of 10 and 14 and it seems to be on the rise. Only accidental deaths and homicide follow it. Some experts believe that many ""accidental"" deaths are actually suicides. According to a 1991 Center for Disease Control and Prevention study, 27% of high school students thought about suicide, 16% had a plan and 8% made an attempt. Suicide affects teens of all races and social standing. Boys commit suicide more often than girls do. It could be because it's easier to get the tools for suicide, boys usually use firearms and girls often use pills so since the gun is more deadly, boys complete suicide. Over the past 15 years, the rate among girls has scarcely changed, but the rate among boys has tripled. Also, the rate among non-white males, even though it's still lower than the white male rate, has been rising most quickly of all. Suicide remains the second leading cause of death among whites after accidents and the third among blacks after homicides and accidents. Teen suicide is now considered a national mental health problem. The main two causes for teen suicide is the mental disease of depression and family problems. 90% of teen suicide victims have at least one diagnosable, active psychiatric illness at the time of death, which is most often depression, substance abuse, or behavior disorders. Only 33-50% of victims was known by their doctors as having a mental illness at the time of their death, and only 15% were in treatment at the time of death. The pressures of modern life are greater these days and competition for good grades and college admission is difficult which are extra stresses on already unsure teens. Some even think it's because there is more violence in the media. Lack of parental interest may make them feel alone and anonymous.",cause and effect
"Can you remember the last time someone lied to you? Or how about the last time you lied to someone else? Did you ever stop and ask yourself why? There are so many different reasons that a person might lie. Maybe a lie about something to keep oneself out of trouble, or even a lie to impress other people. But either way there are always going to be serious consequences or effects of lying. People lie everyday to, in someway or another, keep themselves out of trouble. Many teenagers will lie to their parents about what they are doing for the evening, how much of their homework they have done, or how that glass vase got broken while they were out of town. We even lie to our significant others about who that other boy was that called the house or what exactly we did with our friends last night. All anyone is trying to accomplish by this is to stay out of trouble when we know we’ve done wrong. But we never think of the effects of lying. Although we think we’re being sly, parents are usually smarter than we give them credit for! And eventually our boyfriends and girlfriends will find out! Then the problem becomes the issue of trust. If you lie, there is no trust. That can be one of the serious consequences of lying. How about lying to impress other people? More common in children and teenagers, we lie to make others think we’re cool. And when you really think about it, that’s the part that’s not cool! Most young people care too much about what other kids think. Everyone always wants to fit in with the crowd so they lie about things to make them fit in. What happens when the plan backfires? The downside effect would be that once people know that you are constantly lying to them, they wouldn’t think you’re cool at all.",cause and effect
"There is little doubt that animals raised on small-scale diverse farms are apt to be healthier. When allowed to range freely, particularly in organically maintained yards and pastures, they receive more exercise, their diet is more varied and they are exposed to commensal bacteria that help exclude, and build resistance to, harmful pathogens. Some organic practitioners also argue that free-ranging animals actively seek out plants with medicinal properties that can build their resistance to illness, When Livestock production is carried out on a scale that suits the global market, however, huge numbers of animals are kept in tightly confined conditions, and the potential for disease outbreaks is much higher.. The important considerations of animal welfare aside, these methods lead to 
the rampant use of antibiotics, which poses a significant health risk, not only for the livestock, but for consumers as well, since antibiotic residues can remain in meat and milk. Roughly half the 25,000 tonnes of antibiotics produced in the United States are used in the raising of animals for human consumption. There are other reasons for concern about the overuse of antibiotics in giant livestock operations. Some 40 to 80 percent of the antibiotics used in farming are thought to be unnecessary even under factory conditions, as 80 percent of their use is as a preventative measure and for growth promotion. Overuse has already rendered some drugs ineffective and may even make some strains of bacteria untreatable.",cause and effect
"The United States is facing an epidemic of seriously violent crimes in middle schools and high schools across the country. At least fifty people have died due to a series of high school shootings. These shooting rampages have occurred across the United States in 13 cities ranging from Pennsylvania to southern Mississippi and to western California. Just when the murder rampages seem to be subsiding, another tragedy occurs. Preventive measures have been taken by the government and school systems. For instance, in 1994, Congress passed the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act, which provides for support of drug and violence prevention programs. However, these programs have not been effective in taming the ferocious dispositions of the particular young kids who have participated in these shooting rampages. Therefore, parents, school officials, and the government are still left wondering what is the cause of the horrific violence and how can they solve the problem. A widely accepted cause of the murders committed by children is violence in the media. The parents of three students killed at a high school in Padukah, Kentucky filed a $130 million lawsuit against the entertainment industry because they believe that violence in the media inspired the boy, Michael Carneal, who killed their children (""Media""). To some extent, these parents are correct in their assumption. On average, children watch television 16 to 17 hours per week, beginning as early as age 2 (Strasburger 129). Furthermore, when video games are added, some teenagers may spend as many as 35 to 55 hours per week in front of the television set (Straburger 129).

"We have five cats that live in our house. This was not our original plan, but it turned out that way. My family got two tortoiseshell-colored kittens, Kit-Fat and Minkie when I was nine and my sister was seven. Two years later, we were preparing to move to the country, and our pastor's daughter had three kittens to give away. Our pastor convinced us that we needed cats outside in the country. At that age, Risa and I were greatly in love with kittens. Subsequently, three tabby kittens named Duff, Muff, and Buff came to live with us. But alas, our move was delayed and these adorable fluff balls lived inside for the next six weeks. When we finally moved, the whole family was too attached to these kittens to out them outside and subject them to the dangerous world. Therefore, we became a household with five cats. To this day, we are still reaping the consequences of that choice. Occasionally, there is an article in the newspaper about a house where the people have many cats and do not care for them. The cats are allowed to take over the home and a severe mess results. This is obviously the extreme result of having too many inside cats. However, even in households where the cats are well taken care of, problems can result from a profusion of inside cats. The biggest problem with a multiple cat household is the interaction between the various cats. Many problems stem from this interaction. Cats can be very territorial creatures. In a multi-cat situation, there is also a pecking order and a dominant cat. We have four females and only one male, so our male naturally became the dominant cat. This caused a problem because before Duff came, our oldest female was dominant.",cause and effect

"“Bible Belt Couples ‘Put Asunder’ More,” the New York Times proclaimed on May 21 of this year: “The divorce rate in many parts of the Bible Belt is roughly 50% above the national average.” So much for the notion that secularism is to blame for the decline of traditional families, among other frequently lamented social ills. Apparently, in a least a few states, the divorce rate correlates to an excess of piety, not the absence of it. What do we make of this amusing correlation? I doubt that religiosity directly causes divorce, but in some cases it may cause marriage, by condemning premarital sex and cohabitation as sinful; and marriage, of course, is the one indisputable cause of divorce. Marry in haste; divorce when you come to your senses. “I had this vision that this is just what people do; Get married, have kids and Christ comes back,” one Oklahoma divorcee told the New York Times. She remarried, but a great many Oklahomans apparently prefer living in sin. (Religion may not cause marriage after all.) According to the Times, the number of unmarried cohabitating couples in Oklahoma increased 97 percent in the past ten years. It increased 125 percent in Arkansas and 123 percent in Tennessee. The average national increase in unmarried couples for the same period was 72 percent. Statistics like these are deeply troubling to God-fearing social conservatives like Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who declared a “marital emergency” in his state; and Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, who has initiated a multimillion dollar campaign to strengthen marriage by sending publicly funded “marriage ambassadors” to talk shows and public schools and providing premarital education.",cause and effect
"For a child, it is very hard loosing a parent. The child's life becomes more stressful because of economic loss and the loss of a supportive parent. Since many children do not adjust well, their behavior is affected. The change is devastating for many children and it affects their entire life. Divorce of parents causes many problems and affects children negatively. The loss of a parent can cause loss in knowledge, skills, and resources from the parents. They loose such things as support from the parent in finances, emotions, and care. Children tend to have a harder time dealing with a divorce the more divorces their parents go through. The better the parents adjust to these losses, the better the children will adjust, and the fewer problems that will come about. When the child is in a single parents home, there is usually a loss of money and therefore, resources. This can lead to the child being jealous of other children and having lower self esteem. 
Another cause that affects a child with divorced parents is that the child may have a more stressful life. The child may have to change schools with any move that may result from the divorce. Also, if the child is not old enough to take care of himself or herself and the now single parent works, the child would probably have to start attending a child care program. A child could have to alternate between parents in different houses which is also very hard on a child. The adjustments to different settings and what days he or she is at which house can be confusing and stressful. In a divorce, the parents usually do not get along and may have different opinions on items. They may go to court and fight against each other about what factors caused the separation leading to the divorce and how the properties are divided. This possible exposure is very unhealthy for a child. The child sees his parents fighting and may learn from the behavior and display it. He or she may see that behavior as being an acceptable action. The fighting behavior of parents causes behavioral problems within a child. The child may hear things from one parent about the other that causes the child to take sides when he or she should be learning not to be biased and to love both parents equally.",cause and effect
"The causes of social problems exist on many levels. When we ask why social problems such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and war exist, each time we determine a cause, we can ask ""why"" again, as children often do until they are hushed. Poverty exists because some folks can't find jobs or the jobs pay poorly. But then why is the wage level so low? Because of the tax and land-tenure systems. Why do we have those systems? Because special interests pay to legislate it. Why do special interests get away with it? The voting structure lets them. Why does that structure exist? The voters don't demand to change it. Why not? When we dig down through all the layers to the roots of the causes, we find three fundamental causes of social problems: ignorance, apathy, and greed. The ultimate remedy for social problems therefore must confront all three root causes. It does little good to just run down the street shouting ""share the rent!"" or ""stop war!"". Uttering a slogan does no good unless it arouses sympathy. As an example of the interplay between ignorance, apathy, and greed, consider the problem of pollution. Suppose the most efficient preventative is a pollution charge based on the damage caused by each pollutant. However, the government regulates pollution instead, a policy failure that needlessly reduces employment and economic growth. One possible cause is ignorance. But suppose the best policy is known. The owners of the polluting industries seek to influence legislation to prevent the best policy. Because of their campaign contributions and other favors, the government adopts the poorer policy.",cause and effect
"It was probably inevitable that one day people would start suing McDonald's for making them fat. That day came this summer, when New York lawyer Samuel Hirsch filed several lawsuits against McDonald's, as well as four other fast-food companies, on the grounds that they had failed to adequately disclose the bad health effects of their menus. One of the suits involves a Bronx teenager who tips the scale at 400 pounds and whose mother, in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said, ""I always believed McDonald's food was healthy for my son."" And the tooth fairy really put that dollar under his pillow. But once you've stopped sniggering at our litigious society, remember that it once seemed equally ludicrous that smokers could successfully sue tobacco companies for their addiction to cigarettes. And while nobody is claiming that Big Macs are addictive -- at least not yet -- the restaurant industry and food packagers have clearly helped give many Americans the roly-poly shape they have today. This is not to say that the folks in the food industry want us to be fat. But make no mistake: When they do well economically, we gain weight. It wasn't always thus. There was a time when a

"Driving is a simple task that many of us do on a daily basis. Most people are safe drivers, while a few are incapable of driving safely. Safe and capable is how most senior citizens can be viewed; however, there are some factors that can make a senior citizen dangerous behind the wheel. Some of the problems with the elderly today are that their reflexes react slower, they are hearing impaired, or a physical health change can be a big problem. Research has shown everyone ages differently and growing old does not necessarily mean a person becomes a safety hazard on the road. Much depends on the person's physical and mental health as the years pass. Because people age differently there should be certain test given to the elderly after the age of 65. First, an annual hearing test should be given to the elderly. About thirty percent of those over age 65 are hearing impaired. The ability to hear is more important to driving than most people realize. Hearing can warn a driver of danger signals like the sound of screaming sirens, honking horns, or screeching tires. There are occasions when a driver can hear a car but can't see it because of a blind spot. Good hearing helps drivers to be sensitive to what is happening on the roadways around them. Secondly, An annual visual acuity test should be given to the elderly. The elderly are not tested periodically so more often than not visual changes occur and go undetected. Passing a simple eye-test should 
guarantee clear sight. But many elderly people have visual defects that make it difficult for them to see road signs and pedestrians. Senior citizens may need to slow their vehicles to read a road sign, which can put them at risk for an accident with faster traffic. If they do not slow down, the risk may be smaller, but they cannot read the sign. Obviously, challenge of driving is not one that can be easily solved for the elderly. Lastly, a test on sensory motor skills should be given to the elderly.",cause and effect

Moreover, there are no restriction on smoking and cigarettes are being sold worldwide, people are making money from it by selling these deadly things that can ruin today’s young generation’s whole life. Additionally, government should ban smoking, in order to protect young generation. “In one sense, the case for a federal smoking ban in public housing is plain: Smoking is terrible, and smoking bans in public places are good for the public.” In addition, “In 2012, $9.17 billion was spent on advertising and promotion of cigarettes—more than $25 million every day, or more than $1 million every hour.” ",cause and effect

"Enjoying an alcoholic drink moderately is not bad on occasion, but it may have health benefits. Many people use alcohol as an escape route from personal and social pressures that lead to abuse. Abuse of alcohol can lead to alcoholism or alcohol addiction, in which that person becomes physically dependent on alcohol to where they cannot function without it. Not only is the health of that individual at risk, but alcohol causes a destructive behavior, such as driving under the influence and domestic violence. Drinking large quantities of alcohol leads to binge drinking which not only carries a serious risk of harm it is the most common factor to alcohol poisoning. Binge drinking is a form of alcohol abuse where an individual drinks more than the five alcoholic drinks in a 2 hour time period or less. There are many reasons that people become binge drinkers. Some may say they do it because it is fun, but they do not realize the consequences that they are putting upon themselves. They also say that they want to socialize and feel more self-confident, while others want to forget their problems. Again, peer pressure is another big issue when it comes to many teens and young adults. They are seeking to rebel, and fit in with others. People don’t realize they have an addiction when it comes to drinking until it is too late. They will start playing the blame game, blaming someone else for the bad things that happen in their life means they never have to say they’re sorry.

"Gender inequality has plagued the world for as long as we’ve inhabited it. Women in the United States have been in the shadow of men, not allowed basic human rights, because they were told that that’s how things are supposed to be. Centuries later, women have received many entitlements in which they deserve, but not without the ongoing battle of equality. Stereotypes of women in America after the American Revolution enforced the existing social hierarchy. As their social values continued to plummet nearing the 20th century, the main responses of women included banning together to fight for equal rights, and remote causes such as the “Declaration of Sentiments” helped launch history-changing movements like the American Women’s Rights Movement. Women have a long history of being treated the equivalent of servant. For many years leading up to the “Declaration of Sentiments”, women were only responsible for having and taking care of the children and keeping the house clean. They had no voice in politics, but they also had no voice at home. On July 13th, 1848, a group of women, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, were fed up with injustice and began discussing their frustrations over tea. They felt the strong need for a change, like many other women during this time, because they believed that they had positive influences for the society and deserved for them to be heard. This powerful group of women gathered with others and created a form of “The Declaration of Independence” that included female rights as well, which they called, “The Declaration of Sentiments”.

"An estimated amount of 160,000 students across the United States misses school each day due to being a victim of bullying. From a present study, 29% of students involved in bullying, 14% of the children were said to be victims, 7% were bullies, and 8% were bullies and victims. The worst type of social behavior stems from bullying, and leads to complications in a student’s future. Bullying is a way of expressing aggressive behavior that is intended, and continues that sometimes leads to physical or mental injuries. Those who are victims of bullying, lack self-esteem, and become easily depressed by small objects. There are four common types of bullying: verbal, physical, relational aggression, and cyber. Females and males tend to use different tactics when it comes to bullying. For example, females resort to verbal bullying and relational aggression by name-calling and regulating stations. Whereas, males are physically aggressive. Both sexes, are impulsive and enjoy the “status” they establish from the negative emotions they deliver.A common cause of bullying is the type of family environment that a bully grows up in. The lack of parental attention causes a feeling of insecurity leading someone to acquit bullying. Unfortunately, adult role moles, parents, teachers, coaches, can build up tension in a student to generate them to bully. Students that are neglected, have divorced parents, or are around the influence of drugs/alcohol are more controlling and impulsive by nature. Those who have younger siblings are more suitable to bully in order to feel empowered.",cause and effect

""The real root cause of crime is family breakdown,"" the three analysts contend.

"Many people all over the world are concerned about pollution. Gasoline use in automobiles is one of the major causes of pollution. When gasoline is used it releases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide. These are gasses that contribute to the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect refers to the trapping of the sun's radiation and is also used synonymously with Global Warming (greenfuels.org). Governments are trying to come up with alternatives to gasoline to improve or at least not hurt our environment as much as gasoline does. There are things we can do to help out the environment. One suggestion is better public transportation systems. For example, Des Moines has a public bus system, but not very many people use it and the busses do not reach all parts of the city. As a result, many people drive themselves to work instead of taking the bus and saving gasoline. Another way to cut emissions of vehicles is a type of vehicle that uses an electric motor or a vehicle that uses both an electric and gasoline motor which cuts gasoline use. Also there are alternatives to gasoline that do not release as many harmful agents into the environment. Ethanol and hydrogen are two examples that are more environmentally friendly than gasoline. So, if the federal government were to increase the gas tax by one dollar per gallon, the public would have more incentive to buy the alternatives that are better for our environment than gasoline because of the much higher price. Also, with the increase in the gas tax the money would give funds toward the environment.",cause and effect

Influenza and pneumonia was the main cause of death in the 1900’s which is still present today. Many diseases spread fast and shocked the United States. Scientists and doctors came together to form vaccination shots. Many vaccination shots were introduced to prevent horrifying and transmitting diseases that started being identified in the 1990’s.Vaccination shots were created to help prevent diseases with babies and future diseases with adults. The benefit of vaccination shots is effective because vaccine strengthens immune systems, prevents the disease from spreading, and providing a healthy, longevity life.Vaccines are proven to strengthens immune systems against life-threatening diseases. When babies are born their immune systems are weak and vulnerable to catch disease. Children who are vaccinated are less common to die from an infectious illness. During the 1940, a bad case of tuberculosis was discovered in the U.S and U.K (Brooks). Albert Calmette, a famous French bacteriologist, found the vaccination for tuberculosis.

"Drunk driving is a severe offense around the world and if caught driving under the influence severe punishment follows. Taking cold showers or drinking water or strong coffee cannot remove the blood alcohol content in the body. Only time can remove all alcohol from the body. Most people that drive under the influence of alcohol are knowledgeable that they are intoxicated; however, they make themselves believe that they are stable enough to operate a motor vehicle. Many fatalities can be caused by drunk driving, such as becoming a paraplegic or even worse death.
Driving under the influence of alcohol affects reaction time and is very dangerous not only for the driver and passengers in the car but for pedestrians and other drivers on the road. Each drunken driving ad targets different audiences; some may target different age groups while others target specific genders. Approximately every hour, someone dies or is severely injured from a drunken driving-related the incident. In the first drunk driving PSA, the audience being targeted is teenagers and adults that are not aware of the serious repercussions that come with driving while intoxicated. When going out with friends it 's always safe to have a designated driver just in case you plan on consuming alcohol.

"Alcohol consumption in many countries has increased significantly over the last decades and its effects range from injuries, birth defects, health problems and alcohol abuse disorders. Alcohol abuse increases the risk of being injured and it is associated with burns, drowning and homicide. It is also associated with sexual assaults, accidents, falls and suicide. Suicide may result from excessive drinking which can actually make a person more reckless in judgment. As substance abuse disorder, it can lead to debilitating and serious disease and mental health conditions that may lead to suicidal behavior (National Institute of Health, 2015, p. 4). It can also cause relationship problems, work problems, legal problems and social problems. Coupled with the effects of alcohol, this can lead to suicide (Understanding Alcohol Use Disorders & Their Treatments, 2016). As such, there is a strong relationship between alcohol abuse and suicide. Nevertheless, correlation does not automatically indicate or mean causation in most of these cases.This paper reviews a study conducted by Maurizio Pompili, Gianluca Serafini, Marco Innamorati, Giovani Dominici, Stephano Ferracutti, Georgio Kotzladis, Guilla Sera, Paolo Garardi and Luigi Janiri on the effects of alcohol abuse on suicidal behavior.

"Drinking and driving is a serious and dangerous problem around the world for many people. Many people every year are killed or injured because of drunk drivers. When a person’s blood alcohol content, known as BAC, is over the legal limit he becomes much more impaired and are at a higher risk of hurting himself or others while driving on the road. The majority of people who drive when under the influence of drugs or alcohol do not believe that their skills are affected until after they face a challenging or dangerous situation. It is then they realize their coordination and ability to think and respond according to the certain situation is affected. Driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs make people drowsy, causes problems with focusing and the ability to follow objects with eyes. These issues can all lead to very dangerous circumstances, especially when the person under the influence is behind the wheel of a car, van, truck or motorbike. Driving under the influence is dangerous because it leads to road accidents, an individual can get legal penalties, and an individual is putting his safety and others safety at risk.First of all, driving when affected by drugs or alcohol, or a combination of drugs increases the risk of being involved in an accident. To securely drive a vehicle, good coordination, and mental alertness is required all the time. Moreover, slowed reaction times caused by sleepiness or fatigue will put both the driver and other motorists on the road at risk.

"One of the hardest things to do in life is to realize that something needs to be changed and to complete the change. It is difficult to understand sometimes, that there is need for change; many people will not even know that they are wrong and need changing or be against change completely. But it is important to continuously create change and understand why change is important. There are three reasons that I believe would cause someone to struggle to create change: The environment around the person changes, they become more educated, and they can no longer suffer in their position. The environment around someone can constantly change, whether it is the physical environment like our ecosystem or the environment of world and people around them. If a school system is changing its ways of teaching, the students must change their ways of learning or risk getting left behind. The student must also change their way of thinking and learning in order to keep up, and example we have seen recently is in Common Core teaching. This is a new method of learning that has spread all around America. If a child does not choose to change, it would become difficult to continue learning considering most school systems are using this new method. It is important for someone to struggle to change, in order to keep up with what is going on around them, but they must also be willing to change. When reading the stories of Harry Potter by J.K.

Hurricanes have killed more people worldwide in the last fifty years than any other natural cataclysm (Emanuel, 2005). Not all storms turn into hurricanes and not all hurricanes hit land.

Hurricanes form through a simple process.Hurricanes begin as tropical storms of the warm moist waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The beginning of a hurricane is a low-pressure area containing cloudiness and precipitation with no strong wings. Heavy rain can occur. There is a pressure drop in the center of the storm. Wind speed picks up and starts rotating in a patters, and heavy rainfall begins. Winds increase to speeds of thirty-nine to seventy-three miles per hour.

"Blood pressure is a descriptor of the force that blood exerts on the walls of arteries through which it travels, and this pressure varies with the rhythmic contractions of the separate parts of the heart. Systolic pressure occurs when the cardiac muscles on the atrial or ventricular portion of the heart tighten to either move blood from the atria to the ventricles or expel blood from the heart. The ventricular systole, which pushes blood out of the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and aorta, is the strongest and most noticeable of the two and results in the highest pressure change in arteries. A pause between the systolic contractions is called the diastole, when the heart is at rest and the atria are filling up with blood; no events take place to raise the blood pressure at this time.",descriptive

Classic Airlines needs to use the information they have in their CRM system to understand the value of their customer and develop a plan to satisfy those needs and values. Classic Airlines is the fifth largest airline in the world (Scenario, 2008). They are on a downward spiral in their customer loyalty program, number of flights per loyalty customer and the company stock price. The loyalty program has seen an almost 20% decrease in the last few years. This reflects the change in attitude of customers that do not feel the program is worth staying with. The customers that are left are not flying as much or they are not flying with Classic Airlines since the number of flights for the remaining customers has dropped about 21%. The company stock price has dropped 10% in the last year. This is a reflection of the change in attitude and uncertainty in flying that has permeated the industry since late 2001. Classic Airlines has some work to do to hold their position and gain more customers. The airline has the information it needs to turn the situation around. Their CRM system is one of the best in the industry but was not set up to maximize the information opportunities. By reworking the parameters and connecting it to the company phone system, Classic will be able to use the information they collect to boost their loyalty program and increase their customer base. Classic also has an opportunity to enter into an alliance with a European and a South American airline which they could include in the loyalty program.",problem and solution

"Canada has a problem with obesity and a solution should be established. Junk food is easily accessible and because of this, low-income families are more likely to buy bigger quantities of it due to lower costs. Obesity can lead to diseases and serious illnesses, some of the most likely illnesses to get from obesity include Type 2 Diabetes, Uterine Cancer, and Gallbladder Disease. While these illnesses and diseases are bad, the population of people that have them can be decreased by decreasing the amount of sugary, carbonated, and high sodium foods humans consume. Junk food should be taxed because it will decrease consumption and reduce obesity rates as well as incidence of diseases, while the revenue generated by these taxes can be used to fund education programs to teach healthy living. First, the main issue trying to be fixed using taxes on junk food is reducing the obese population, the tax will include foods containing high; sugar, sodium, and calories. By adding a tax, people will stop buying unhealthy foods daily. Being able to decrease the number of unhealthy food people eat, will better our overall health, and will decline our obesity rates. A study done ""as of 2003, US states without sales taxes on soft drinks or snack foods were 4 times as likely as states with a tax to have a relative increase in the prevalence of obesity"" (Franck, Grandi, & Eisenberg, 2003). This is a good example of how taxing junk food will help the populations problem with obesity. With easier access to junk food, people are more likely to buy it because it is a cheap substitute for the pricey healthy food. ",problem and solution
